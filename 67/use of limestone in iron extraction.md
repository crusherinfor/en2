## limestone iron extract
What is the use of limestone of in the extraction of iron Answer: Usually, limestone (calcium carbonate, CaCO3) is "calcined" in a lime kiln, where it is heated to form lime (CaO) and CO2 gas. The lime is then used in both steelmaking furnaces to refine liquid iron into steel, and also on ladles as slag to further refine the steel.
