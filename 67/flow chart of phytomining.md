##  Phytomining & Bioleaching By Lucy Patterson (Sophie's Sibling)
Phytomining isnt a very expensive method of extraction. It uses waste ores, reducing the impact of mining on the enviorment . Carbon dioxide is released as the plants are burnt which adds to global warming. The process can also take a very long time.

Phytomining involves the production of a 'crop' of metals by growing high-biomass hyperaccumulators that accumulate high concentrations of metals (Robinson et al. 1999a).In contrast to simple phytoextraction techniques, the goal of phytomining is primarily to realize the economic benefits and commercialization by comprehensive use of hyperaccumulator plants that can extract and accumulate

## Phytomining - Key Stage Wiki
Phytomining has several stages: Plants are grown in an area with low grade ores where they take in the minerals through their roots. The plants are then burned. The ash is added to water and the minerals dissolve in that water. Electrolysis is then used to extract the metal from the mineral. Phytomining is cheaper than smelting but takes much

Plants suitable for phytomining are called hyperaccumulators because they accumulate large amounts of metals in their tissues and sap. Most plants don't grow well in metal-contaminated soil, and the ones that can thrive mainly do so by leaving the toxins in the soil, not absorbing them. Hyperaccumulators, however, employ a different approach

## Phytomining: Can plants really grow gold? - Manhattan Gold & Silver
The method of using plants to extract particles of gold from soil is called phytomining. It works by taking a fast-growing plant with leafy mass, such as mustard, sunflowers or tobacco, and planting the crop on soil that contains gold. Once the plants grow to their maximum height, the soil is then treated with a chemical to make the gold soluble.
