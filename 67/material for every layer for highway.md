This material is petroleum in a viscous liquid or semi-solid form. When it is used for pavements and road construction it comes in the form of a composite material, asphalt concrete. Asphalt concrete is about 70% asphalt and 30% aggregate particles. Asphalt is one of the most commonly used materials for road construction for a number of reasons.

Multiple construction methods can be used to process rock and soil into aggregates: crushing, blasting, washing, excavating, dredging, and screening. When the composition of the grains or fragments has not been altered, then it is considered a natural material. These natural aggregates are commonly used for highways and other construction projects.

## Highway Pavement: Layers, Functions, Types, Defects, Rigid and Flexible 
Under certain circumstances of traffic and availability of materials, a semi-rigid type of pavement may prove to be economical. 4. Composite Pavements: A composite pavement comprises multiple, structurally different layers of heterogeneous nature. A typical example is a concrete pavement of two layers, sandwiching a brick layer.

The sub-base layer works by distributing the surface load over a wide area, and it dramatically improves the ability of the top surface to carry heavy loads and maintain integrity notwithstanding long and repeated use..
