In 2019, coal accounted for 44 % of the global energy-related CO 2 emissions. (IEA, 2019: Global energy & CO 2 status report 2019). The main reasons for the extensive use of coal are its abundance all over the world, its accessibility, easy storage and portability. Furthermore, extraction as well as processing of coal is not capital intensive.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit
