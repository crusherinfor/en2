The density of manganese oxide ore is generally about 3.7~3.9t/m3, which is significantly different from silicate type gangue. Commonly used gravity separators include mineral jigs, shaker table, cyclones, chutes, and the like. The density of manganese carbonate ore is 3.3~3.6t/m3, which has a small difference from the density of gangue.

## Manganese Mining Process - JXSC Mining
Manganese gravity separation process flow: the raw ore enters the silo, is broken into a rough jaw crusher through a belt conveyor, and then enters the fine crusher for secondary crushing. After two crushed ores, the ore is basically free of large stones. The vibrating screen is screened. The crushed ore is divided into two grades of 0-8mm and
