## India faces iron ore shortage with mine auctions on the horizon
India is broadly self-sufficient in iron ore, as indicated in the second graph above, which shows that imports are minor compared with exports. However, this situation is likely to change, at least temporarily, owing to the iron ore mine auctions for the renewal of mining leases in 2020 in the key producing state of Odisha.

India's iron ore production is estimated to have risen by 14.2% in 2019, to reach 234.9Mt, owing to the acceleration in mine production for several non-captive mines - especially from merchant miners due to the expiration of leases in March this year. Production in 2020 is expected to decline to 205.7Mt; a delay in mineral auctions in Odisha
