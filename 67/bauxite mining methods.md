Mining and Refining - Process. The Bayer Process was invented and patented in 1887 by Austrian scientist Karl Josef Bayer. Two to three tonnes of bauxite are required to produce one tonne of alumina. 90% of the global alumina supply of around 90 million tonnes is used in aluminium production.

## Bauxite
Bauxite ore contains 30-60% aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3). In the Bayer process (Figure 2), the bauxite is digested in a pressure vessel along with a sodium hydroxide solution (caustic soda) at an elevated temperature, which dissolves the aluminum oxide converting it into sodium aluminate, leaving insoluble red mud solids as a by-product. The alumina is extracted from the bauxite by means of the

Bauxite is mined by surface methods (open-cut mining) in which the topsoil and overburden are removed by bulldozers and scrapers. The topsoil is then stored and later used for revegetating and restoring the area after mining is completed. The underlying bauxite is mined by front-end loaders, power shovels or hydraulic excavators.
