## Ijen
The Ijen volcano complex is a group of composite volcanoes located on the border between Banyuwangi Regency and Bondowoso Regency of East Java, Indonesia.It is known for its blue fire, acidic crater lake, and labour-intensive sulfur mining. It is inside an eponymous larger caldera Ijen, which is about 20 kilometres (12 mi) wide. The Gunung Merapi stratovolcano is the highest point of that complex.

## What is Sulfide Mining? | Mining Action Group - Save the Wild U.P
If sulfide ore or sulfide tailings are exposed to water and air during mining, a chemical reaction creates sulfuric acid - basically battery acid. There has never been a sulfide mine that has not polluted nearby water resources. Pollution from sulfide mining is very expensive to fix, and a burden for taxpayers.

## H2SO4 gas detector, Sulfuric acid, Hydrogen sulfate - GazDetect
Sulfuric acid ( H2SO4) - also known as hydrogen sulfate - is applied to produce fertilizers and many chemical products (detergents, phosphoric acid). It is also largely used in metal treatment for pickling and chromating. At last, sulfuric acid is employed for producing both explosives and in batteries - particularly for lead car batteries.

Protection from Heat and Cold. In open-pit mines in cold climates, miners will have winter clothing including thermal socks, underwear and gloves, wind resistant pants or over-pants, a lined parka with hood and a winter liner to wear with the safety cap. In underground mines, heat is more of a problem than cold.

The soot-particle concentration was in the range of 10 4 to 10 6 per cm 3, whereas the particle-number concentration of sulfuric acid aerosols was about 10 8 per cm 3. Fig. 19.3 shows an example of MEA emissions in the presence of soot and H 2 SO 4 aerosols in the flue gas. A clear trend of increased emissions at higher particle-number concentration is observed.

## Sulfuric acid as a dehydrating agent | Experiment | RSC Education
Sulfuric acid is well known for its ability to act in three distinct ways: as an acid, as an oxidising agent, and as a dehydrating agent; these demonstrations support the third of these. For a suitable audience you can also use the reaction with sucrose to illustrate the oxidising action of concentrated sulfuric acid.
