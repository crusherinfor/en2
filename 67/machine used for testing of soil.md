## How to Use a Soil Test Kit | Lowe's
Take a 1/2-inch slice along the side of a hole and place it in the bucket. Repeat this process for all the holes. Collect samples from different areas that'll be growing similar plants. Mix the soil in the bucket. Spread the soil on a newspaper to dry it out. Collect a pint for your sample.

## Pilot-scale feasibility study for the stabilization of coal tailings 
A rotary cultivator was used to simulate soil tilling equipment. Both treatment solutions were poured across the surface of the pilot cell at an approximate rate of 0.25 L/s, after which, the upper 15 cm of soil was tilled in 1.0 m × 0.3 m sections to allow for adequate mixing between tailings and treatment solutions.
