## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

## Business & Biodiversity - Mining and Quarrying
The quarrying sector's primary impact on biodiversity is through the removal of surface features during the extraction of minerals. Through this process, habitats can be altered or destroyed. Secondary effects of the quarrying process, such as noise, dust, pollution and waste removal can also impinge on plants and animals.

How is limestone extracted? Limestone is extracted from the rock either by blasting or mechanical excavation depending on the hardness of the rock. rough crushing. After crushing the stone is sorted into different fractions by screening after which it goes to be processed further. In the grinding process the limestone is ground to a fine powder.

Limestone mining is done out in the open. Once studies show the existence of stone at the site, the extraction is made by separating the rock in quarry benches and dividing it into blocks. Before beginning the quarrying process, a resource analysis is made. This study investigates the existence and quantity of stone at the site and also the economic viability of the process.
