rH - Redox Value A soil rH below 25 indicates low oxygen, limited biological activity, and a consequent lack of humus-building. A soil rH over 29 indicates too much oxygen, resulting in oxidation of organic material and loss of carbon to the atmosphere, limiting nutrient availability to the crop. rH value is derived from the ORP and pH readings.
