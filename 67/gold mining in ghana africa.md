The ancient kingdom of Ghana was located 800 kilometres north of the modern-day capital city, Accra, crossing into modern-day Mali and Mauritania (Hilson, 2002).At the time, the name Ghana strictly referred to the region's king; however, it was later used by Arab merchants, who traded gold for more than 700 years prior to the arrival of Europeans, to refer to the wider region (Hilson, 2002).

Gold mines built by Chinese investors have destroyed water bodies in the heart of Ghana, Africa's second-largest gold producer. River pollution caused by digging up the surrounding land areas have led to deforestation, dying fish and undrinkable water. Some rivers have dried out completely, and deforestation has impoverished many local farmers.
