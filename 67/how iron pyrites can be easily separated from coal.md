If you scrape or polish the surface of these tiny pieces you can see the gold color of the pyrite without the oxidized surface. Marcasite is another form of iron pyrite and is easily mistaken for fool's gold. It has the same basic chemical formula (FeS2), but just as coal and diamonds are two forms of carbon, so is marcasite and iron pyrite.

## Advances in depressants used for pyrite flotation separation from coal 
Pyrite is separated from other minerals mainly by flotation. However, the hydrophilicity of pyrite is affected by many factors, causing it to easily enter the concentrate and consequently reduce the quality of concentrate. Highly efficient pyrite depressants can be selectively adsorbed on the surface of pyrite to improve its hydrophilicity, thereby increasing the flotation separation

## Raw Coal Spillage Or "Pyriting"
As it name implies, the pyrite chute is for discharging pyrites and tramp iron. The term "pyrites" refers to a compound typically contained in coal deposits that is a combination of Iron and Sulfur (FeS2). It is also commonly called "fools gold" because it can be shiny and similar in appearance to gold.
