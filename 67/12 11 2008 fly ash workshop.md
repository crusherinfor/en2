## ACI PRC-232.2-18: Report on the Use of Fly Ash in Concrete
Fly ash is used in concrete and other portland cement-based systems primarily because of its pozzolanic and cementitious properties. These properties contribute to strength gain and are known to improve the performance of fresh and hardened concrete, mortar, and grout. The use of fly ash typically results in more economical concrete construction.

## Fly ash - INSIGHTSIAS
Fly ash is a major source of PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) in summer. It becomes air borne, and gets transported to a radius of 10 to 20 kms. It can settle on water and other surfaces. Fly ash contains heavy metals from coal, a large amount of PM 2.5 and black carbon (BC). Proper disposal of fly ash is still not happening in
