## Milling (machining)
Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.

## Milling Machine: Parts, Types, Operations, Milling Cutter [PDF]
May 12, 2021Milling is the machining process in which the removal of metal takes place due to the cutting action of a rotating milling cutter.In a milling machine, the cutter is rotating due to workpiece is fed against it.This machine can hold more than one tool at a time. The cutter rotates at high speed, and because of the many cutting edges, it removes metal at a very fast rate.
