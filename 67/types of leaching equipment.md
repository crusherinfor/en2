## Leaching
Agriculture. In agriculture, leaching may refer to the loss of water-soluble plant nutrients from the soil, due to rain and irrigation. Soil structure, crop planning, type and application rates of fertilizers, and other factors are taken into account to avoid excessive nutrient loss.Leaching may also refer to the practice of applying a small amount of excess irrigation where the water has a
