## Report: Mass Nickel Mining Probably Won't Be Great for the Environment 
Sep 1, 2020Global demand for nickel is estimated to increase six-fold by 2030, according to a recent analysis from the Financial Times. That's great news for miners, especially considering the material presently costs $15,320 per metric ton. But it needs to be refined before being fit for battery production, and that creates massive amounts of waste.
