##  GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS: RISKS AND MITIGATION 8.1 Identifying and  - Utah
8.1 Identifying and Profiling Geological Hazards . Geologic hazards are those geologic conditions that present a risk to life (injury or death), of substantial loss or damage to property, or damage to the environment. Geologic hazards affect Utah, negatively impacting life safety, health, property, and the state's economy.

## Indoor Environmental Quality: Construction & Renovation | NIOSH | CDC
Particulate material such as dusts and fibers are likely to be produced during construction and renovation activities. Sources include drywall, plaster, concrete, soil, wood, masonry, flooring, roofing, and ductwork. Dusts are irritants and can exacerbate lung conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease.

## Environmental Solutions - Construction Industry Considerations
Protection of stormwater drains has emerged as a major priority for any construction site. Control of oils, fuels and hydrocarbons and, increasingly, the prevention of silt, sediment and debris is important. The need to prevent these contaminants from entering waterways has seen the introduction of Environmental Managers on many projects.
