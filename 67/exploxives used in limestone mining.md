## Is limestone used in coal mines? - Origin of coal
Why is limestone scattered around a coal mine? Limestone powder, known as rock dust, is spread throughout the mine workings on a regular basis. .. When explosions do occur, the dispersed limestone powder absorbs the heat generated from the explosion and will either stop the chain reaction or reduce the intensity of the explosion.
