## Silica and its role in the production of iron and steel
Silica (from the Latin word 'silex'), is an oxide of silicon. It is a compound made up of silicon and oxygen atoms and has the chemical formula SiO2. It occurs commonly in nature as sandstone, silica sand or quartzite. It is the most frequently found in nature as quartz (SiO4). It is the major constituent of sand.

## Silica Sand - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The production of sand fillers is simple because it includes, at most, only washing and classification into grades differing in grain size. Because sand has a negligible degree of porosity, it has an extremely low specific surface area in the range from 40 to 160 cm 2 /g. The material usually contains more than 99.7% SiO 2, with absorbed water being at a negligible level (0.1%).
