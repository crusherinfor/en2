A fixed jaw, mounted in a V-shaped alignment, is the stationary breaking surface, while a movable, "swing" jaw exerts force on the feed material by pushing it against the stationary plate. The space at the bottom of the "V"-aligned jaw plates is the output gap that dictates the size of the crushed product from the jaw crusher.
