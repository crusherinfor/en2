The compressive strength and flexural strength of concrete made from m sand are higher than natural sand. When it is used in concrete the permeability of concrete is very poor as compared to river sand. It is artificially manufactured so there are no oversized materials. The water absorption of crushed sand is 2 to 4 %.
