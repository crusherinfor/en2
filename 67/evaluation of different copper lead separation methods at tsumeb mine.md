Tsumeb, company town, north-central Namibia. At an elevation of 4,232 feet (1,290 m), the town is a northern terminus of the country's north-south railway and lies on a main trunk highway about 275 miles (440 km) north of Windhoek, the capital. In 1851 Sir Francis Galton, a British explorer, made note of copper ore deposits in the vicinity of what later became the town of Tsumeb.

## Tsumeb | Cape Minerals
Tsumeb, a world renowned copper-lead-zinc deposit in Namibia, produced some of the finest minerals known today between the years of 1907 and 1996. The mine survived two world wars, led to the naming and discovery of several knew species (Including best-in-class specimens) and comes with a multitude of stories from collectors, academics and

## Copper-Lead-Zinc ores - Danafloat
Other factors related to the specific copper and lead mineral processing characteristics must be considered when deciding on which copper or lead mineral will be floated from the other, for instance relative mineral flotation kinetics. The subsequent Cu-Pb separation flotation step is usually conducted at alkaline pH regardless.
