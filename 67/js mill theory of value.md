The ratio will be stable when the value of each country's exports is just enough to pay for its imports.

## John Stuart Mill's Harm Principle and Free Speech: Expanding the Notion 
This article advocates employing John Stuart Mill's harm principle to set the boundary for unregulated free speech, and his Greatest Happiness Principle to regulate speech outside that boundary because it threatens unconsented-to harm. Supplementing the harm principle with an offense principle is unnecessary and undesirable if our conception of harm integrates recent empirical evidence

Influence and significance of John Stuart Mill. Mill was a person of extreme simplicity in his mode of life. The influence that his works exercised upon contemporary English thought can scarcely be overestimated, nor can there be any doubt about the value of the liberal and inquiring spirit with which he handled the great questions of his time. Beyond that, however, there has been considerable

## Lecture 4: Freedom of Speech: John Stuart Mill (1806 - 1873)
This is the theory known as utilitarianism. It is summarized in the thesis that we have a moral duty to act in such a way as to promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number. By "happiness" Mill understands pleasure (though some pleasures are higher than others) and the absence of pain.

A close relative of Martin's paper was published in a journal in 2008, and whilst Martin has added to this version it is still the case that little of it addresses Mill's Art of Life generally and it is largely focused on a specific issue in Mill's moral theory: namely what type of Rule Utilitarianism Mill holds.

Meanwhile, Some disadvantages of utilitarianism are that it is not the only thing of value and the end doesn't justify the means.

## Utilitarianism: Summary | SparkNotes
Utilitarianism, by John Stuart Mill, is an essay written to provide support for the value of utilitarianism as a moral theory, and to respond to misconceptions about it. Mill defines utilitarianism as a theory based on the principle that "actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness."

## Utilitarianism: John Stuart Mill - God and the Good Life
John Stuart Mill () is considered the most influential English-speaking philosopher of the nineteenth century.  In estimating the value of anything else, we take into account quality as well as quantity; it would be absurd if the value of pleasures were supposed to depend on quantity alone.  This theory of higher and lower order

Mill thinks this theory of value is actually quite simple: everyone, including laypeople and philosophers alike, values happiness and nothing else.
