## gold processing | Britannica
gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms

A commerative gold ingot from the first gold pour using our cyanide-free recovery method. The infrastructure for a processing plant that uses cyanidation typically costs $30 million, and is therefore, a barrier to entry for gold miners with smaller deposits that do not fit into the large-scale economies of gold production.

The water loss in the concentrator (the moisture in the product) accounts for only 0.5%. In iron ore concentrator plants, which have higher product mass yield than copper plants, the water consumption increases to 15% at the concentrator and decreases to 85% at the tailings dam. In both plants the water consumption in the tailings dam is high.
