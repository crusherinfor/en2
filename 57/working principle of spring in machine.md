## Working and Principle of tablet compression machine
The tablet compression machine works on the principle of hydraulic pressure. The hydraulic pressure is converted into the static fluid that pressure applied on static fluid from all directions resultant a tablet of granules or powder. The force from the lower die and upper punch allow granules to take a shape and strength.

Working principle of spring machine. The spring machine is a device that relies on a pair or two pairs of feed wheels to compress the steel wire, and the rotation of the feed wheel drives the steel wire to move forward in a straight line. The gears on the feeding wheel shaft are driven by sector-shaped incomplete gears.

## How do springs work? | How do springs store energy? - Explain that Stuff
Apr 17, 2022It takes energy to deform a spring (change its shape): that energy is stored in the spring and you can use it again later. Springs are great for storing or absorbing energy. When you use a pushing or pulling force to stretch a spring, you're using a force over a distance so, in physics terms, you're doing work and using energy.
