## Dolomite Stone: The only article you'll need to read about it
Feb 11, 2022Synonyms to luxury and modernism, dolomite, also known as dolostone, is a sedimentary rock composed of the mineral dolomite. It is a common mineral in hydrothermal veins, and it can be found in formations of hundreds or thousands of feet thick. Dolomite is relatively soft and easily cut or cracked, hence its importance in the mining of precious

## Calcitic vs Dolomitic Limestone in Growing Media | PRO-MIX Greenhouse 
The two main types of limestone are calcitic limestone and dolomitic limestone. Although both have similar effects, there are a few important differences. Greenhouse growers know that in order to achieve optimum nutrient availability for plant growth, a growing medium's pH should be within 5.5-6.2, depending on the crops grown. The standard
