## Introduction of the whole mud gold cyanide leaching process
The process flow of the all-slime cyanidation gold extraction method can be divided into six stages: crushing and screening, grinding-gravity separation, secondary classification, dedusting and pulping, cyanidation leaching and desorption electrolysis. The specific process flow is as following: 1. Gold ore crushing and screening process

## Gold Cyanidation
Process. Cyanide can be used to extract gold, either in a controlled mill environment, or more crudely on rock piles in the open. Cyanide "vat leaching" mixes finely crushed ore with a cyanide salt in water. The cyanide binds to the gold ions, and makes them soluble in water, thereby allowing separation from the rock.

How is cyanide used in mining? A sodium cyanide solution is commonly used to leach gold from ore. There are two types of leaching: Heap leaching: In the open, cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads. The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap.

Dec 4, 2020The Cyanidation process contributes to the recovery of more gold. The process is about oxidation and dissolving of metallic gold in an alkaline cyanide solution. Atmospheric oxygen acts as the oxidant in the process. The oxidant helps to dissolve the gold and forms sodium hydroxide as well as sodium cyanoaurite.

Cyanide leaching has been the industry standard for gold processing for more than 100 years. During the cyanide leach process, a cyanide solution, or lixiviant, is percolated through ore contained in vats, columns or heaps. Gold is dissolved by the cyanide and then removed from the heap or columns.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

## The Safe and Effective Use of Cyanide
A process called "Cyanidation", or cyanide leaching, has been the dominant gold extraction technology since the 1970s. In this process sodium cyanide, in a dilute solution of ranging from 100 ppm to 500 ppm or 0.01% to 0.05% cyanide, is used to selectively dissolve gold from ore.
