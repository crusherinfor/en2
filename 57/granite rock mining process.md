Original Rock: granite, gabbro. Environment: Gneiss forms at high temperatures and pressures. The temperature needed is about 700Â°C and the pressure needs to be about 12-15 kilo bars, which is at a depth of about 40 km! Distinguishing Characteristics: banded with alternating layers of dark and light minerals.

The quarrying process consists of separating large blocks, sometimes called loafs, from the surrounding rock. These blocks may be 6 metres high by 6 metres deep and 12 to 18 metres (about 40 to 60 feet) long, and they may weigh in the range of 1,200 to 2,000 tons. (Such large blocks are subsequently divided into mill blocks weighing 15 to 70 tons.)

## Granite Rock - Mining Hub Africa
Granite Rock. Granite is the most common type of intrusive igneous rock in the Earth's crust. It forms when the molten rock or magma seeps in the gaps in sedimentary rock layers, and crystallizes slowly owing to its high silicate content. The entire process takes millions of years, and is just a small part of the rock cycle.

Mining granite is a very large industrial process. The first step of making a granite slab is to mine the raw granite materials out of the crust of the earth in large, heavy blocks.  After this, an open cast mining process is used to extract it from the earth. The process includes drilling holes through the rock and then using hydraulic

Granite is an intrusive igneous rock, which means it was formed in place during the cooling of molten rock. Generally, the slower the molten rock cooled, the larger it's mineral crystals with K-Feldspar megacrysts forming in special circumstances greater than 5cm. During formation of granite it is buried below kilometers of rock and sediment

There are different methods used by mining companies to cut and extract the deposits from the ground which are called quarries. When the granite is extracted, the mining team uses large equipment such as extractors and cranes to slowly dig around the deposits.
