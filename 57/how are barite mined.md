Most barite is mined from layers of sedimentary rock which formed when barite precipitated onto the bottom of the ocean. Some smaller mines utilize barite from veins, which formed when barium sulfate was precipitated from hot subterranean waters. In some cases, barite is a by-product of mining lead, zinc, silver, or other metal ores.

Barite is the principal ore of barium. Barium has very high number of applications. It is known to have more than 2000 industrial uses. However, the majority of barite mined is not used to extract barium. It is valuable in its native form because of high density. It is mostly used by oil & gas industry as an ingredient of drilling mud.

Barite is a mineral composed of barium sulfate (BaSO 4 ). It receives its name from the Greek word "barys" which means "heavy."

## Barite Mineral Physical - Optical Properties, Uses and Occurrence
Barite is the main ore of the element barium. It is also important in the manufacture of paper and rubber. Barite is also used in radiology for x-rays of the digestive system. When crushed, it is added to mud to form barium mud, which is poured into oil wells during drilling. A rich, white pigment was once made from crushed Barite.

## Barite Gem Guide and Properties Chart | Gemstones
Barite gets its name from the Greek word baros (heavy) due to its high specific gravity. Barite is mostly mined as an ore for barium. It can form as crystals or as an aggregate. The mineral is most often white or colorless but can form in array of colors. Crystals are transparent to opaque with prismatic, tabular, bladed, or acicular habits.

How was barite mined? Most barite is produced using open pit mining techniques, and the barite ore then typically undergoes simple beneficiation methods to separate the mineral from the ore.Methods such as washing, jigging and tabling, which involve separating it in water or shaking it, are used to isolate the dense material.
