Phosphate is absolutely essential for high agricultural production, one of the "big 3" nutrients that boosts maximum crop growth (along with nitrogen and potassium). It's estimated that Morocco has of 75-85% of phosphate reserves that might last for years. But that may not be correct, as Walan (2014) points out in the paper below.

About 2-4% fluorine is usually present. There are about 400 plants using this wet process worldwide, with capacity of some 50 million tonnes P 2 O 5 per year. Some phosphate deposits - about 4% of total known - are igneous, created by magmatic extrusion as an alkaline chimney. The main mineral is apatite, with some fluorapatite.
