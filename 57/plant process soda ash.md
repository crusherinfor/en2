## ammonia-soda process | chemical process | Britannica
ammonia-soda process, also called Solvay Process, modern method of manufacturing the industrial alkali sodium carbonate, also known as soda ash. The process was devised and first put to commercial use by Ernest Solvay, who built a plant in 1865 in Couillet, Belg., and was improved in the 1870s by the German-born British chemist Ludwig Mond.

Soda ash is prepared by two methods one by Solvay process or ammonia soda process and other by mining naturally occurring trona ores. Today, the mining route of Soda Ash production accounts for around 33% of global production, which means that the majority of Soda Ash is prepared industrially by the Solvay process.
