With mechanical polished concrete, the shine and abrasion resistance come from the concrete itself. We apply chemical hardeners in between layers of polishing. The higher the diamond polishing grit we finish the floor to will depend on the desired level of shine. This process can involve 10 - 15 individual steps and is costly and labor-intensive.
