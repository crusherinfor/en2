Iron Ore Introduction: Ore, which contains an economical use of iron, is called an iron ore. There are many types of iron ore, magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3) and (FeCO3), etc, which are mainly used for iron making. Iron ore is an important raw material for iron and steel production enterprises.

## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.
