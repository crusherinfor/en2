## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)Â·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

More attention is paid to ironmaking as the most energy consuming segment of the process chain. For example, blast furnace ironmaking including sintering and coking plants consumes about 65-75% of the entire energy at an integrated steelworks (ca. 11-12 GJ/t hot metal) (Babich, 2009).Both direct and indirect coal use, e.g. in the form of coke, is presented.
