## Sunflower Profile | Agricultural Marketing Resource Center
Oil-type sunflower seeds contain from 38 to 50 percent oil and about 20 percent protein. If the hulls are removed from the seeds prior crushing, they are often used as an energy source for the processing plant. Every 100 pounds of sunflower seeds yields about 40 pounds of oil, 35 pounds of high-protein meal and 20 to 25 pounds of other by-products.

Most U.S. sunflower production tiiroughout the late 1970's and early 1980's was exported. As sunflower and otiier oilseed production increased in Europe and Argentina, U.S. exports fell, and a larger portion of the crop was used domestically. Oil exports have replaced seed exports as the primary ouÃ¼et for U.S. sunflowerseed.

Fill a plastic bag with no more than Â½ cup of sunflower seeds so the seeds lie in a single layer when the bag sits on its side. Seal the bag and gently roll the rolling pin over the seeds to crack the hulls. Empty the contents of the plastic bag into a bowl of water so the hulls (shells) rise to the top and the kernels sink to the bottom. Skim

Both shelled and unshelled sunflower seeds attract birds, and there are many pros and cons to both sides.
