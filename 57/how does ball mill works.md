Tramp metal in the ore such as scaling bars and rock bolts cut the rubber and can become lodged in the grate openings. This puts an excessive strain on the grates. When the mill rotates the metal is pushed and twisted by the ore. This stretches the rubber and can cause severe damage to the face and the back of the grate.
