U.S. Pat. No. 3,779,380 to Bishop describes ore beneficiation and particularly froth flotation applied to iron ore. The beneficiation process described enables direct flotation of the iron oxide. This process, however, is not as efficient when dealing with fine grained ores as is the present process.

## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.
