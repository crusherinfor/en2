## 3 Types of Rock Formations | Sciencing
Igneous Rocks. •••. Igneous rocks are one type of rock. These rocks are associated with volcanoes and form at plate boundaries, either as magma under the ground hardens or as lava flows over the surface and cools. Magma cools to form intrusive igneous while lava cools to form extrusive igneous rocks. Many igneous rocks are basalt or

## Iron Formation - Michigan Technological University
Iron is abundant in the earth and in the meteorites that accumulated and melted during the Hadean. This iron was mainly in a reduced state (ferrous iron), and so when the Earth cooled and rain fell on these Hadean volcanic rocks, iron dissolved and was carried as ferrous ions to the ocean. This situation doesn't happen today, because the high content of oxygen in the ocean and atmosphere

This rusted iron is in the different layers of banded iron formation (BIF) created about 3.7 billion years ago. The alternating layers in banded iron formations represent rock being oxidized. This is when early photosynthetic life was just trying to get started by releasing free oxygen into Earth's early atmosphere.

## Iron ore
Iron ores [1] are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite ( Fe. 3O. 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite ( Fe. 2O.

## Iron-rich sedimentary rocks
Iron-rich sedimentary rocks are sedimentary rocks which contain 15 wt.% or more iron. However, most sedimentary rocks contain iron in varying degrees.  This form of iron gives up electrons easily and is a mild reducing agent. These compounds are more soluble because they are more mobile. Fe 3+ is the ferric form of iron. This form of iron is

## Types of Rocks - Igneous | Sedimentary Rocks | Metamorphic Rocks - BYJUS
Igneous Rock. Igneous rock is one of the three main rock types. Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. Igneous rock may form with or without crystallisation, either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks.. This magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planet's mantle

Metamorphic rocks are formed by heat and pressure, and pyrite could be formed as part of this process, or may form as a replacement mineral within the rock.

## Metal, iron, & nickel | Some Meteorite Information | Washington 
The Earth's environment is far more oxidizing (oxygen atmosphere and water) than space, where meteorites originate. Earth rocks do contain iron and nickel, but only in oxidized (non-metallic) form. Therefore, if you find a rock that contains iron-nickel metal, then it is almost certainly a meteorite.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth?
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however, because iron does not occur naturally, it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

Igneous rocks that form by cooling deep in the ground (over several kilometers down) are called plutonic rocks, from the Roman god Pluto, god of the underworld. Granite is an example of a plutonic rock, often cooling slowly in magma chambers. Eventually, some magma will reach the surface, erupting as lava (molten rock that flows on the surface

## how iron rock is form
 Oxygen prefers to form compounds with a particular form of iron called "ferric iron" or "iron (III)." In an ocean without much oxygen, ferric iron precipitates as iron oxide. This iron (III) oxide falls to the ground and becomes incorporated in rock while another form, ferrous iron or iron (II), mostly stays in the water.

## Igneous Rocks - Definition, Formation, Examples & Types - Science Terms
Igneous rocks are created when a melt cools and freezes solid. High temperatures inside the earth cause a solid rock to transform into a flowing melt. When this melt cools, it forms a new igneous rock. The word igneous is derived from the Latin root ignis, which means fire. Igneous rocks are the most abundant rock type on the planet.
