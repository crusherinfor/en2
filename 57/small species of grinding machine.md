Manufacturers use grinders for grinding milling cutters, surface grinding, contour grinding, and flute grinding. 6-Axis CNC Machine 6-axis CNC mills are a step above 5-axis milling machines. These remarkable machines use an additional rotation axis along the Z-axis, resulting in a noticeable speed improvement over the 5-axis variety.

Wind-powered machines may have been known earlier, but there is no clear evidence of windmills prior to the 9th century. Hero of Alexandria (Heron) in first-century Roman Egypt described what appears to be a wind-driven wheel to power a machine. His description of a wind-powered organ is not a practical windmill, but was either an early wind-powered toy, or a design concept for a wind-powered

## Grinding Machines: Types and Selection Principles - Mining-pedia
Grinding machine has been widely used in gold mines in South Africa since 1905. At that time, the grinding machine used river pebble as the grinding medium, which was essentially a gravel mill. Later, in order to improve the production capacity of the mill, cast iron balls were used as the medium, so normal gravel mills were evolved into ball mills and rod mills.
