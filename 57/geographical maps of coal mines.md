Longwall mining is one of the oldest methods of mining coal. Before the widespread use of conveyor belts, ponies would descend to the deep, narrow channels and haul the coal back to the surface. Today, almost a third of American coal mines use longwall mining. Outside the U.S., that number is even higher. In China, the world's largest coal
