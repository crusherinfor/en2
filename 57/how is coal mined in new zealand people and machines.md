## Coal mining and transportation - Energy Information Administration
In surface mining, large machines remove the topsoil and layers of rock known as overburden to expose coal seams. Mountaintop removal is a form of surface mining where the tops of mountains are dynamited and removed to access coal seams. Once the coal is removed, the disturbed area may be covered with topsoil for planting grass and trees.
