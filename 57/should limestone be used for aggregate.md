## What does limestone do to soil?
What is the use of lime stone? It is the raw material for the manufacture of quicklime (calcium oxide), slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), cement and mortar. Pulverized limestone is used as a soil conditioner to neutralize acidic soils (agricultural lime). Is crushed for use as aggregate—the solid base for many roads as well as in asphalt concrete.
