## The Hidden Environmental Toll of Mining the World's Sand
Sand mining is the world's largest mining endeavor, responsible for 85 percent of all mineral extraction. It is also the least regulated, and quite possibly the most corrupt and environmentally destructive.

## Mining has great economic potential for Bhutan - The Bhutanese
Mining in Bhutan has become a polemic subject although almost every item in the house comes from mining. For its size of the country, Bhutan is blessed with many minerals.
