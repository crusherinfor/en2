## Coal | WWF - Panda
The use of coal can be traced back to around A.D. 50 from cinders in Roman ruins in Britain. There is also evidence to suggest that the Greeks used coal as a fuel in the 4th century. However, extensive mining of coal in Britain only started in the 13th century. To find out how coal was mined in the 18th century, try this web page.

## Negative Effects of Coal Mining
Chemical, Air & Dust Pollution: Underground mining allows coal companies to dig for coal deeper into the ground. The problem is that huge amounts of earth and rock are brought up from the bowels of the earth. These mining wastes can become toxic when they are exposed to air and water. Examples of toxins are mercury, arsenic, fluorine and selenium.

Health effects from coal mining include: the release of methane (CH 4), a potent greenhouse gas estimated to account for 18% of the overall global warming effect triggered by human activities (CO 2 is estimated to contribute 50%).; the release of carbon monoxide (CO) from explosives, which pollutes the air and poses a health risk for mine workers.
