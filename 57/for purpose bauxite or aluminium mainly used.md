What is Bauxite? Bauxite is primarily a metallic mineral though it is also used as an industrial mineral. It is the only ore used for large-scale aluminium production. Although aluminium is the most abundant metallic element in the earth's crust constituting about 8%, it usually occurs in clays, soil and rocks that cannot be utilised for its extraction.
