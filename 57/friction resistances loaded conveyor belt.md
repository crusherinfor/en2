## Preventing losses: Fire Resistant Anti Static (FRAS) Conveyor Belts
Fire Resistant Anti Static (FRAS) conveyor belts are engineered so that the top and bottom covers of the conveyor belt meet local fire retardancy standards. This means these belts are difficult to ignite and should never be the cause of a fire. Additionally, if ignited by an external fire source, they should minimize the propagation of the fire.

## Friction Standard Multi-Ply Conveyor Belts - Replacement Belts 
The slippery coating on this multi-ply conveyor belting reduces friction between the belt surface and the items being conveyed on it so items can slide freely on the belt's surface. Low-friction belting is used in applications where conveyed items will be allowed to accumulate on the conveyor belt to control flow.

When installing a conveyor belt, it is important to use sufficient pre-tension. If the pre-tension is too low, you lose grip on the drive after the fabric has been relaxed and it may slip. For a conveyor belt with PET fabric, the pre-tension at installation is at least 0.3% (0.5% for PA fabric), which is usually sufficient for correct operation.
