## Garment Manufacturing Process from Fabric to Finished Product
See the Garment manufacturing process flow chart of a typical garment product. This chart would help you understand the process flow in a better way. As a garment maker, garment factories normally purchase fabric from various fabric suppliers. Prior to sourcing the fabric, there are some pre-production processes handled by the factory merchandiser.

Wikipedia mentions that there are three different processes used to solubilize the cellulose used for rayon: 1. The viscose process, which uses alkali and the neurotoxin carbon sulfide, is the most common. 2. The cupro process [sometimes called the cuprammonium process ], uses ammoniacal solutions of copper salts.
