Screw conveyors primarily consist of a rotating screw shaft that is installed within a trough. As the screw shaft rotates, the material moves linearly. They can be designed to provide horizontal, vertical, and inclined travel paths. Several types of screw conveyors are designated to handle a specific material behavior.
