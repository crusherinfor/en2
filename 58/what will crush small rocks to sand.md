## Gravel Calculator
Gravel is a loose mixture of rock fragments formed as a result of erosion. Gravel, along with other types of rock fragments such as sand and crushed stone, is commonly used for construction purposes, though it has other uses as well. Rock fragments are typically classified based on the size of the individual pieces that make up the aggregate.

## Sand, gravel, and crushed stone operations | GeoKansas
Small amounts are also produced from sandstone in central Kansas. Rock used to make crushed stone is mainly extracted from large open pits, or quarries, dug specifically for that purpose. The rock is blasted from quarry walls and then crushed to various sizes, depending upon what it will be used for.

## Stone Dust or Sand - Which is Best for Patio Pavers? - A.L. BLAIR 
Sand is formed naturally, and is found in plenty of environments around the world. Due to environmental forces, rocks experience weathering - breaking down upon impact of other surfaces - and erosion - having small rock bits transported away by water - ultimately leading to sand. For hardscaping projects, sand makes a great paver base.
