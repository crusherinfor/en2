## Wisconsin Geological & Natural History Survey » Graphite
Description: Graphite occurs primarily in metamorphic rocks where it forms by the deterioration of organic compounds during metamorphism. It thus can be found in schists, marbles and quartzites that form from the metamorphism of sedimentary rocks. Most of the Wisconsin graphite is fine-grained sooty material intergrown with other minerals in

## Rock Hunting in Michigan: Best Locations & What You Can Find
Lying on an old Precambrian surface, the Michigan Basin is composed of a series of sedimentary rocks. Ancient igneous and metamorphic rocks are at least 3.5 billion years old. The state's official rock, the Petoskey stone, is actually a fragment of a Devonian coral reef that disappeared at the Paleozoic Era's end.

By. Terence Bell. Updated on August 21, 2020. Most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium-containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium-containing rock, such as spodumene.Lithium production from clay sources is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022.

## Metamorphic Rocks | National Geographic Society
Granite is an igneous rock that forms when magma cools relatively slowly underground. It is usually composed primarily of the minerals quartz, feldspar, and mica. When granite is subjected to intense heat and pressure, it changes into a metamorphic rock called gneiss. Slate is another common metamorphic rock that forms from shale.

Dolomitic Marble is a coarse-grained, non-foliated metamorphic rock composed primarily of dolomite. It is usually white or off-white, but if impurities are present it may also contain colors like pink, gray, blue, or green. Dolomitic Marble is formed from the low-grade metamorphism of dolomite.

## Rocks and Minerals | Indiana Geological & Water Survey
The feldspar mineral family is the most abundant. Quartz, calcite, and clay minerals are also common. Some minerals are more common in igneous rock (formed under extreme heat and pressure), such as olivine, feldspars, pyroxenes, and micas. Metamorphic rocks are those that have been transformed by pressure and heat but that have not actually melted.

## 7: Metamorphic Rocks - Geosciences LibreTexts
Metamorphism is the process that changes existing rocks (called protoliths) into new rocks with new minerals and new textures. Increases in temperature and pressure are the main causes of metamorphism, with fluids adding important mobilization of materials. The primary way metamorphic rocks are identified is with texture.

Here are ten common examples of metamorphic rocks. 1. Soapstone Soapstone is a soft, dense heat resistant rock. The metamorphism of ultramafic protoliths forms it. Its primary component is talc with traces of chlorite and carbonates. Soapstone is suitable for curving because it is soft and heat resistant. 2. Marble

Four main methods of mining are available: underground, open surface (pit), placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and often used to reach deposits that are deeper. Surface mines are usually used for deposits that are shallower and less valuable.
