Little is known about the forces that determine the assembly of diverse bacterial communities inhabiting drinking water treatment filters and how this affects drinking water quality. Two contrasting ecological theories can help to understand how natural microbial communities assemble; niche theory and neutral theory, where environmental deterministic factors or stochastic factors predominate

Approximately 5% come from the purification of high-quality quartz. Since the early 1950s, FSA has been the main additive used for water fluoridation in the United States. The favorable cost and high purity of FSA make it a popular additive. Sodium fluorosilicate and sodium fluoride come from processing FSA, or from processing hydrogen fluoride.

Pathlength correction is based on the absorption of water in the near IR area. It can therefore be used only with samples in a water -based buffer, or at least a buffer that has a signifi cant water content. A typical liquid pathlength in a microplate assay can be assumed to be around 2-5 mm, corresponding roughly to a μl assay volume.
