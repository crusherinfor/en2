59. The white Portland cement is pretty convenient for manufacturing every wall decoration. Here are a few advantages of using white Portland cement in civil constructions. If you have to build concrete-made thermal insulation. Then white cement is going to be your best pick. White Portland cement has good light-reflecting quality.

Steps of Cement Production Process .  In the cement production process, each ton of portland cement requires the grinding of at least 3 tons of materials which include all kinds of raw materials (fuel, clinker, gypsum, mixture, etc.).  But power consumption is the largest in the last process of cement manufacturing.

The manufacture of Portland Cement takes place in a number of steps: At TCL's Mayo Quarry, limestone, one of the main ingredients in cement manufacture, is excavated. The limestone raw material then goes through several categories of 'crushing', until it is fine enough for water, sand and iron oxide to be added to produce a mixture known as Slurry.
