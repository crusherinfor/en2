## Coal | National Geographic Society
Coal Mining Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. Once coal has been extracted, it can be used directly (for heating and industrial processes) or to fuel power plants for electricity. Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining.

## The coal mining life cycle - Mining for schools
Mine development. Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. In open-pit coal mining, a pit is dug in an area and this pit becomes the open-pit mine, sometimes called a quarry.Open-pit mines can expand to huge dimensions, until the coal deposit has been mined or the cost of transporting becomes too great.
