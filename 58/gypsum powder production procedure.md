Brief Introduction of Gypsum Powder. The natural gypsum powder includes anhydrous gypsum and CaS04.2H2O, if you want to commercialize the gypsum powder, you should adopt the CaS04.2H2O, after removing part of water by heating, it will become CaS04.1/2 H20. CaS04.1/2 H20 is the final product which you can use it to produce gypsum board other

Gypsum rock is first mined or quarried, then crushed and ground to a fine powder. It then goes through a process called calcining where heat at 350 degrees is supplied to the gypsum powder which removes 3/4 th of the water molecules.

## Gypsum powder - Jonoub Gypsum
Gypsum powder. Gypsum powder (hydrous calcium sulfate/calcium dehydrate or CaSO4-2H2O) is a white, smooth powder that is derived from heating gypsum rock. When gypsum is heated in air it loses water and converts first to calcium sulfate hemihydrate, (often called "plaster") and, if heated further, to anhydrous calcium sulfate (anhydrite).
