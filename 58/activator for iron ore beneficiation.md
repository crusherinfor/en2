## Application of biotechnology in iron ore beneficiation
In 20-40 years' time, all the world's quality iron ore will be gone, and only low-grade ore will be left for processing, so more efficient and economic beneficiation techniques will be necessary. Commercial iron ore flotation systems have concentrated on the removal of quartz (silica) as the steel industry requires feedstock that is < 2% SiO

## Existing and New Processes for Beneficiation of Indian Iron ores
The iron ore industries of India are expected to bring new technologies to cater to the need of the tremendous increase in demand for quality ores for steel making. With the high-grade ores depleting very fast, the focus is on the beneficiation of low-grade resources. However, most of these ores do not respond well to the conventional beneficiation techniques used to achieve a suitable

By use of this flotation agent, the iron oxide in the ground ore is directly floated away from the remainder of the ore.

## Iron ore
Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines. Magnetite. Magnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and
