## Pallet Conveyor | Conveyor Systems & Equipment - Bastian Solutions
Belt Driven Live Roller Pallet Conveyor . For lighter capacity applications (less than 1,000 lbs. per linear foot), belt driven live roller pallet conveyor can be an economical solution, often used for accumulation of returnable containers and empty pallets. Roller spacing can be configured and photo eyes can be accommodated for zero pressure

## How to Select the Right Belt Conveyor Roller.au
Nov 22, 2021Two factors contribute to the energy consumption required to operate a large number of rollers on a system. The first is breakaway energy - the power required to get the conveyor started (as much as 13% of your power). The second is the running friction - a substantial amount of energy is required to keep the rollers running.
