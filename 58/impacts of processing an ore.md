## Environmental Impacts of Metal Ore Mining and Processing: A Review 
The impact of mining and smelting of metal ores on environmental quality is described. Mines produce large amounts of waste because the ore is only a small fraction of the total volume of the mined material. In the metal industry, production of Cu, Pb, and Zn causes the greatest degradation of the environment.

ABSTRACT. Mining of metals and their ore produces adverse environmental impacts. These metals include copper, lead-zinc, iron, and gold. Mining of these metals creates adverse environmental effects. including effects on soil, water, air, etc. Most of the metals are mined as sulphides, which when in contact with ground water produces acid water.

## Environmental Impacts - SERC
In terms of both short and long term environmental impact, uranium mining is by far the most environmentally problematic of any mining activity because radioactivity of the ore presents an intangible that cannot be chemically mitigated. Even after the mining activities ceased on the Navajo Nation, the legacy of environmental harm continued from

## Environmental Impacts of Metal Ore Mining and Processing: A Review - ACSESS
Abstract The impact of mining and smelting of metal ores on environmental quality is described. Mines produce large amounts of waste because the ore is only a small fraction of the total volume of the mined material. In the metal industry, production of Cu, Pb, and Zn causes the greatest degradation of the environment.
