## The Composition and Properties of Glass - ThoughtCo
The glass you encounter most often is silicate glass, which consists mainly of silica or silicon dioxide, SiO 2. This is the type of glass you find in windows and drinking glasses. The crystalline form of this mineral is quartz. When the solid material is non-crystalline, it is a glass. You can make glass by melting silica-based sand.

## When Lightning Strikes Sand, It Creates Bizarre Glass Sculptures
"Sweet Home Alabama" did get something right — when super hot lightning (at least 1,800 degrees Celsius/3,272 degrees Fahrenheit) hits sandy beaches high in silica or quartz, it fuses the sand into silica glass beneath the ground. That means you can actually dig up petrified lightning if you know where to look. The movie portrays these glass sculptures as root-like, but fulgurites, as the
