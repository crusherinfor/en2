## Round Belt Conveyors
Round belting is made of polyurethane and is supported by grooved plastic supports on the conveyor slide tray. The suspended belting allows part-cooling air to circulate under the parts and 'gives' when parts are placed on it, providing a soft drop. Spacing between the belts can be adjusted to allow it to adapt to a variety of part configurations.

## Design of a Belt Conveyor • Con Belt
A belt conveyor is comprised of a rectangular bed, flanked by two pulleys that are powered by motors. A large belt is wrapped around the bed and pulleys, subsequently rotating around the bed and pulleys, creating movement in one direction. Belt conveyors can be customized to practically any length, or even built on an incline to move items up

DESIGNING A BULK CONVEYOR STARTS WITH UNDERSTANDING THE MATERIAL Bulk density and repose angle are critical factors. Combined with the target tons per hour these let you size the conveyor in terms of width and feet per minute. These numbers aren't enough though. You also need to understand the characteristics of the material. For example, is it:

The clean, smooth steering surface improves the efficiency and durability of conveyor belts . The working surface of the mobile pulley must not be too smooth or too rough (the surface must not be wrinkled!), As this can cause excessive belt wear, noise and premature belt failure. It is recommended to make a work surface with a roughness Ra = 1.
