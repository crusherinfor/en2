## Travis Perkins MOT Type 1 Sub Base Bulk Bag
Hardwearing, this gravel provides a load bearing stable layer and a flat surface prior to a top coating of asphalt, concrete, shingle or block paving. The fine mixture also ensures minimal voids in the sublayer when compacted. Minimum packed weight of 800kg +/- 5%. Acts as a weed suppressant. Suitable for gardens, patios and driveways.

## What sub-base do I need for my driveway? - Flex Flooring
A sub-base is made up from either unbound granular material or cement bound material and goes under the layer of driveway material that you have opted for. The goal of a sub-base is to evenly spread the load placed on top of the surface, and as a result, evenly across the sub-grade (the underlying ground) below it.

##  Use of Graded Gravel- Crusher Dust Soils As Sub- Base and Base Course 
Satyanarayana et al (2013) studied High Plastic Gravels stabilized with crusher dust as sub base material. Ramanamurthy. v.et.al (2003, 2004), studied utilization of gravel and morrum in geo technical applications. Jain P.K et.al, (2010) studied the stabilization of morrum and their strength characteristics in terms of CBR as a road

## Crushed Concrete in Houston, TX | Call
Crushed limestone was the preferred material in the category of crushed road material when I was in construction. Also, the most expensive. We used crushed concrete quite a bit as well. Generally we would use clay as the base material, folowed by fabric or geotextile, and then the crushed limestone or concrete. Apr 11, 2013 · Thanks for the info.

## Utilization of Crusher Dust Stabilized Gravels as Sub-Base Materials
To arrest these characteristics Crusher Dust has been selected as a Stabilizer. To study the behaviour of Crusher dust with gravels soils as a sub-base material, various percentages of Crusher Dust was added to gravel soils and studied plasticity, compaction and strength characteristics to meet MORTH specification.

## A Study on The Use of Crushed Stone Aggregate and Crusher Dust  - Ijser
Hence, the gradation mixes of crusher dust and Crusher stone aggregate with an addition of 20-30% with respect to Crusher stone Aggregate attaining CBR value greater than 50 can be recommended as Base course and Sub-base course materials and the mixes having CBR greater than 30 can be used as Sub-base material. 5.0 Conclusions:
