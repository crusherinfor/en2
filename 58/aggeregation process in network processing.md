## Throughput in osuid24
The system throughput or aggregate throughput is the sum of the data rates that are delivered to all terminals in a network. Throughput is essentially synonymous to digital bandwidth consumption ; it can be determined numerically by applying the queueing theory, where the load in packets per time unit is denoted as the arrival rate ( Î» ), and

## Smallholder aggregation and processing center initiative to be 
The center is equipped with facilities for aggregation of fresh produce and small-scale wet and dry processing. The installed facilities for aggregation include evaporative cooling technologies (zero energy brick cooler and evaporative charcoal cooler) and the Coolbot cold room which is a low-cost alternative to conventional cold rooms.

Throughput vs. network latency.Network latency is an expression of how much time it takes for a data packet to get from one designated point to another. In some environments (for example, AT&T), latency is measured by sending a packet that is returned to the sender; the round-trip time is considered the latency.It can be useful to think of preemption as a way to reduce scheduler latency.

There is a trade-off between energy consumption for processing data and communication energy spent on transferring the data. An essential requirement in the INP process is to ensure
