## procedure of making cement
Methods of Manufacturing Process of Cement. At present Portland Cement is manufactured by two processes, Dry Process, and Wet Process. The main difference between these two methods of manufacturing of cement is that in the dry process, calcareous and argillaceous raw materials are fed into the burning kilns in a perfectly dry state.The first step in making concrete is to prepare the cement.

## How concrete is made - material, manufacture, making, how to make, used 
Process The manufacture of concrete is fairly simple. First, the cement (usually Portland cement) is prepared.  At the cement production factory, the proportions of the various raw materials that go into cement must be checked to achieve a consistent kiln feed, and samples of the mix are frequently examined using X-ray fluorescence analysis.

## Raw materials for cement manufacturing
Lime Component Limestone: Common forms of calcium carbonate used as raw material for cement manufacturing are limestone and chalk.Limestone is of predominantly fine grained crystalline structure, its hardness is between 1.8 to 3.0 of the Mohs scale of hardness and specific gravity 2. To 2.8. Limestone usually contains admixtures of clay substance or iron compounds, which influences its color.

## Raw Material Handling and Storage - Precast
The majority of precast concrete plants today employ bulk cement in their operations. Bulk cement is stored in circular or square silos made of concrete or steel. Given that cement is sensitive to moisture and must remain dry until used, the silos must be watertight. If kept dry, cement will retain its quality for a very long time.

The ingredients for cement are limestone, clay, sand, and water. The first step is to mix these ingredients together in a large container. The second step is to heat the mixture in a kiln at a high temperature. The third step is to grind the mixture into a powder. The fourth step is to mix the powder with water to form a paste.
