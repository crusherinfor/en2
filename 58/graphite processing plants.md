I would think that you are not too worried about maximising the size of the graphite particles so gentle attrition is the way forward. You need to have a way to physically separate the clay from the graphite before attempting the separation, which would probably consist of classification (depending how fine the graphite has become) then flotation in the presence of dispersant at low percent

## Processing Method of Graphite Processing Plant
Graphite processing plant: Graphite is a allotrope of elemental carbon, and each carbon atom is connected with three other carbon atoms (in a honeycomb-shaped array of hexagonal) covalently bonded to form covalent molecules. Since each carbon atom emits an electron, the electrons are free to move, so the graphite belongs to the conductive body.
