## Impact of Mining On The Environment
The impact of mining is leading to the major issues, like a threat to the entire environment and also damaging the health of all life on Earth. Mining procedures generally require a larger and vast area of land. Deforestation is a by-product of mining and the build up of the mining areas requires constructing roads and residences for the mine employees and often vegetation farms are abolished.
