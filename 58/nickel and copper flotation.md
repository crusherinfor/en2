## Separation of Copper-Nickel by Flotation and Magnetic Methods
The separation of copper and nickel is achieved by differential flotation, if the mineral grains can be liberated by grinding. Normal practice is to depress the nickel sulfides by increasing the pH of the flotation pulp to between 9 and 11 and selectively floating the copper minerals.

## nickel and copper flotation
The flotation of copper-nickel ores has four basic processes as follows. 1) Direct priority flotation or partial priority flotation process: when copper content in ore is much higher than nickel content, this process can be used to separate copper into a separate concentrate. The advantage of this process is that the copper concentrate with
