## Geology and mining — MineFacts
Open pit mining. One precondition for open pit extraction is that the ore body extends up to the surface or is not covered by an excessively thick layer of soil or rock. In most open pit mines, ore is extracted by so-called benching. The mining method is based on the ore being extracted in "benches" at successively lower levels.

## Drilling rate prediction of an open pit mine using the rock mass 
It is influenced by many parameters. Various rock parameters have been used to predict the performance of drilling rigs. Drilling, like the other exploitation stages in open pit mining, has a direct and close relation with the rock mass, and thus would be affected by the geomechanical characteristics of the rock material as well as the rock mass.
