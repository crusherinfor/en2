## Aggregate Supply | Encyclopedia
What It Means. Aggregate supply, along with its complementary concept, aggregate demand, is a term used in macroeconomics (the study of the economy as a whole, as opposed to microeconomics, which concerns the individual parts of an economy). It refers to the supply, or quantity, of all "final products" in an economy.

In this case, the supplier or producer must borne or absorb the tax. When demand is elastic, the effect of tax implemented is raising the price as mentioned in figure 8. However, equilibrium quantity will decrease in this situation. At war situation, demand for fuel will drop and demand for substitutes will increase.

## How does inflation affect short run aggregate supply?
Aggregate supply is the supply of goods, and a decrease in aggregate supply is mainly caused by an increase in wage rate or an increase in the price of raw materials. Essentially, prices for consumers are pushed up by increases in the cost of production. Demand-pull inflation occurs when there is an increase in aggregate demand.

## How Monetary Policy Works Affects Aggregate Demand and the Economy
The contractionary monetary policy reduces the money supply. As a result, fewer credits are available. That makes liquidity in the economy tighten, pushing interest rates up. As a result, loans become more expensive and, consequently, lower aggregate demand through their effect on household consumption and business investment.

Furthermore, if there is a fall in aggregate demand, then, in theory, there can be a loosening of monetary policy to offset the fall in demand. With trade war gaining more traction, the Fed are likely to raise interest rates at a slower pace. However, there are still reasons to be concerned that a trade war can cause a recession.
