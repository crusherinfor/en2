Jul 20, 2022The Philippines is the main producing area of lateritic nickel ore. This type of nickel ore has a complex composition which can be roughly divided into two types: limonite and silicon-magnesium nickel. It is accompanied by only a small amount of cobalt but without sulfur and calorific value, and easy to mine in the open pit.
