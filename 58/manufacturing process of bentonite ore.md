## Process Development Essential to Bentonite Processing Operations
Bentonite is the most commonly employed binder in the iron ore pelletizing, or "balling" process used in the production of steel. The importance of iron ore pelletizing has been on the rise in recent years as high-grade sources of iron ore diminish, buyer preferences change, and producers look to operate more sustainably.
