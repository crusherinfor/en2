## How does coal generate electricity? | National Grid ESO
For the last two years only 1.6% of electricity in Britain was generated by coal, and we've seen significant periods of coal-free electricity generation, including a record 68 day run, in 2020. While globally coal remains the leading source of electricity production, in Britain it will be phased out of the power mix completely by October 2024.

Coal is abundant and inexpensive. Assuming that current rates of usage and production do not change, estimates of reserves indicate that enough coal remains to last more than 200 years. There are, however, a variety of problems associated with the use of coal. Mining operations are hazardous. Each year hundreds of coal miners lose their lives or are seriously injured.
