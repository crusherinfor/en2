Environmental effects of mining Mining is the extraction of expensive minerals or metals from the earth. The economy cannot function without minerals and the products made from mining due to the fact that many of our daily used objects are not organically grown, but are man-made. Everything we rely on depends on mining minerals.

## Mining Pollution: How to Mitigate the Negative Effects of Mining
The process of mining has also caused structural damage to buildings and has led to buildings collapsing. Water: Water pollution in mining is caused by metal contamination and increased sediment levels in streams. This affects the biodiversity of the water and also affects drinking water for humans.

In general though, mining can impact the land/soil, water, air, and all different types of wildlife and living wild organisms. Mining impact can occur: 1. When the land is cleared and modified for conversion into mining use, 2. During mining operations, and 3. Residually after the mining site is abandoned or restored and operations have finished

## Environmental Hazards of Limestone Mining - Seattle PI
Limestone mines use two types of blasting. Small explosive charges set along drilled lines free blocks of stone to be removed for construction. Large charges reduce whole areas of limestone to rubble, which is removed for use as crushed stone. The noise, dust, and impact from explosions can result in noise pollution and dust.
