## Environmental Impacts of Coal Mining - WAF - World Animal Foundation
The most visible impact of coal mining is the stripping and clearing of vegetation in areas where mines are active. This can lead to a loss of habitat for local wildlife and a decrease in biodiversity. In addition, the bare soil left behind after mining can be highly erosive, increasing the amount of sediment that ends up in waterways.
