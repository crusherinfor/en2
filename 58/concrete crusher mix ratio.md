The water cement ratio and aggregate cement ratio together determine the cement content of the concrete mix. Generally, the cement content itself would not have a direct role on the strength of concrete; if increase in cement content is required to improve the workability of concrete mix for a given water-cement ratio, then compressive strength may increase with the richness of the mix.

The advantages of concrete mix design are as follows-. 1. Desired Proportions of Each ingredient. The main aim of the concrete mix design is to find out the desired proportion of each ingredients which are cement, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, water etc. to obtain the required properties of resulting mix. 2.

Rounded off it's basically a 1 : 3 : 3 mix ratio. If I break the weights down per yard of concrete it comes to: 1. Cement = 510.75 pounds. 2. Stone = 1658.75 pounds. 3. Sand = 1496.25 pounds. A sack or "bag" of cement weighs 94 pounds so this tells us a 3000 psi concrete mix is also equal to a 5.5 sack mix of concrete.

## What are the Correct Concrete Mixing Ratios - Ratio Chart
When making your own concrete it's important to use the correct concrete mixing ratios to produce a strong, durable concrete mix. Some basic mixing ratios for concrete are 1:2:3, 1:3:3, 1:2:4. These mixing ratios are based on the proportions of cement : sand : stone in that order. The ratio you use will depend on what psi strength you need.

## Concrete Mix Ratios (Cement, Sand, Gravel) - StructX
Water/cement ratio theory states that for a given combination of materials and as long as workable consistency is obtained, the strength of concrete at a given age depends on the w/c ratio. The lower the w/c ratio, the higher the concrete strength. All materials used for a design including the water quality should be to a high standard.

Westend61/Westend61/Getty Images. The basic mix ratio for concrete is one part water, two parts cement and three parts sand. An alternative ratio is one part cement, two parts sand and three parts gravel with enough water added until the mixtures reaches the consistency of thick mud. Lime is also a common additive to the mix.
