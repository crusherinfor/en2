## How Is Iron Ore Mined - Realonomics
The rock is mixed with water and ground in rotating mills until it is as fine as powder. The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism. The remaining rock is waste material and is dumped into tailings basins. The taconite powder with the iron in it is called concentrate. Which mining method is used to mine iron ore?

## Assessment of Environmental Impact of Iron Ore Mining and its 
However, mining of iron ore has copious negative impacts on the environment. As the mining method for Iron is usually open cast, it degrades natural landscapes, surface and ground water, flora and fauna, as well as the ambient air quality within the mining area and its environs. Water quality is contaminated due to surface runoff and leachate

## Magnetism
Magnetism is the class of physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which refers to the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive phenomena in other entities. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomena of electromagnetism.

In 2018, Australia's EDR of iron ore increased by 3% from 2017 to 49 604 Mt (Table 3). Similarly, there was a 4% EDR increase of contained iron to 24 122 Mt (Table 4). EDR attributable to magnetite deposits have decreased by 1%, likely due to re-assessment of projects and inactivity in the magnetite industry.

## Steel
Steel is an alloy made up of iron with typically a few tenths of a percent of carbon to improve its strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. Many other elements may be present or added. Stainless steels that are corrosion- and oxidation-resistant typically need an additional 11% chromium.Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, steel is used in buildings
