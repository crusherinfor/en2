## Cone Crusher vs. Impact Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone. For impact crusher, the high-speed rotating rotor throw stone into impact plates, stones are crushed via impact energy produced rotating rotor.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
