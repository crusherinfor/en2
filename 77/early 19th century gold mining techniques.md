Early 19th Century - Mid-20th Century By the 1830s Lower Canada had ceased to be self-sufficient in wheat and flour, and increasingly began importing from Upper Canada. The mid-century gross agricultural production of Canada East ( Québec ) totalled $21 million — only about 60 per cent of Canada West's ( Ontario 's) production.

The trade in New World gold and silver depended on the development of new and adequate mining techniques in Mexico and Peru to extract the ore and refine the metal. South German mining engineers greatly contributed to the transplantation of European technology to the Americas, and the Spanish-American silver mines utilised the new mercury.

Gold panning techniques are centuries old, but Isaac Humphrey is credited with introducing gold panning at Coloma in 1848. However, the Mexicans may have beaten Humphrey to the punch as they also had developed the skills in their own country, using a flat dish called a batea. Gold panning was slow even for the most skillful miner.

Posted on December 28, 2011 by GSM. Mankind has mined silver for thousands of years. Two early methods of mining silver were sluicing and hard-wall extraction. Sluicing involves assembling trenches in irrigation holes to filter out heavy metals from the mine. Unfortunately, sluicing is inefficient and ineffective method for obtaining silver.

In the first quarter of the 19th century, Latin America gained its political independence, but mining remained central to life in the old mining colonies. Nonetheless, several important changes took place during the 1800s. For the first time Chile became a significant mining region, but its output consisted of copper and nitrates.
