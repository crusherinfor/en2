## NATURAL RESOURCES SUSTAINABILITY: IRON ORE MINING - SciELO
ABSTRACT: In the present article, a new tool to determine environmental sustainability, the energy impact index (EII) was developed to classify different iron mine projects according to two main parameters including energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. The EII considers the characteristics of the mineral (such as the quality, size, hardness, iron ore grade, reducibility, mineral/waste rate

## Mining and Water Quality | U.S. Geological Survey
Mine drainage is metal-rich water formed from a chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. The resulting chemicals in the water are sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can come out as solids to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage.

## A spatial evaluation of historic iron mining impacts on current 
This paper examines the water quality legacies of historic and current iron mining in the Mesabi Range, the most productive iron range in the history of North America, producing more than 42% of the world's iron ore in the 1950s. Between 1893 and 2016, 3.5 × 10 9 t of iron ore were shipped from the Mesabi Range to steel plants throughout the

## Impact of Iron Ore Mining on Water Quality - Semantic Scholar
Mining operations require water for their functioning directly and indirectly. Since a long time mining industry has been exploiting water without realizing the adverse impact it is having on the environment and the regional ecosystem. Acid mine drainage has become a major concern associated with mining. Water contamination has caused spread of many diseases and has caused loss of life.

The four main losses of water at any mine are usually associated with evaporation (ponds, wetted surfaces), cooling (machines, products), storage of materials (within the tailings voids), and dust control. Water use in coal mining and other soft-rock mining (e.g., salts, oil sands) is very different than its use in hard-rock mining.

## Beneficiation: Quality Starts with the Ore — Metals Magazine
In general, iron ore beneficiation is done at the mining site.

## Turkish Mining | Maxore Mining Inc.
Due to the low iron ore production Turkey is dependent on iron ore imports. Since Turkey has a very substantial steel industry, the iron ore imports are considerable. In 2012, Turkish iron ore imports rose by 18% and reached 7.8 million ton according to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK). The value of iron ore imports was USD 1.15 billion.
