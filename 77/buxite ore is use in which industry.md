Bauxite (Fig. 1.33) is formed by surface weathering of clay rocks around the tropical region and composer of aluminum oxide (Al (OH) 3). It contains 15%-25% aluminum and only ore used for commercial extraction for aluminum. The bauxite occurs as near-surface layers and usually mixed with clay minerals, iron oxide, and titanium dioxide.

May 6, 2021Bauxite Used for Aluminum Production. Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum. The first step in producing aluminum is to crush the bauxite and purify it using the Bayer Process. In the Bayer Process, the bauxite is washed in a hot solution of sodium hydroxide, which leaches aluminum from the bauxite.
