## How to Make Precision Steel Balls | Actforlibraries
The grinding machines are used to perform several different tasks on a batch of steel balls. The first of these tasks is called flashing. The headed balls come out of the header with a certain amount of metal in the form of an equator and poles. These have to be removed before the balls can undergo further processing.
