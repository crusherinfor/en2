Answers. In Opencast method of mining,the unwanted materials laying on top of the mineral are removed. The soft mineral ore is removed by digging. Any mineral ore is broken up by blasting. Huge power shovels are used to dig up mineral deposits. The mineral ore is loaded onto trucks or railway wagon to the processing plant.

## Lesson 7.3: Mechanical Surface Mining Methods - Open Cast Mining 
A significant difference between open pit and open cast mining methods is that in open cast mining, overburden that is removed to gain access to the ore is immediately placed in the previously mined cut. Therefore, reclamation occurs concurrently with other mining activities. Two major sub-methods within open cast mining are area mining and

## Issues with open cast mines | Current Affairs - IAS Parliament
What are open cast mines? Open-pit mining, also known as opencast mining, is a surface mining technique that extracts minerals from an open pit in the ground. It is the most common method used throughout the world for mineral mining and does not require extractive methods or tunnels. Generally a traditional 'cone-shaped' excavation is done.

Open-pit mining is surface mining in which huge portions of earth are dug from the surface to extract the desired mineral within them. During the mining process, the land face is scraped away by explosives and digging creating a deeper and deeper pit until the mining is complete. The final shape of the open pit is decided before excavation begins.

## Open Cast Mining in South Africa - SG
Open cast mining is a useful method of extracting ore near the surface. It allows teams to fast track box cut excavations on gold, platinum and uranium mines as it saves the need for the usual methodological approach. In this article we'll look at what we mean by open cast mining, along with its uses in South Africa.

Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.
