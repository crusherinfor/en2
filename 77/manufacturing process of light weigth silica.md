Silica aerogels are the most common aerogels . On one hand, silica is inorgani c, fir e proof and thermal stable up to 900 °C; one the other hand, the material is brittle and rigid. Due to their brittleness combined with the ultrahigh porosity of aerogels (over 80 %), silica aerogels are very difficult to process into a product.

## Silicon carbide manufacturing process - GAB Neumann
The simplest manufacturing process for producing silicon carbide is to combine silica sand and carbon in an Acheson graphite electric resistance furnace at a high temperature, between 1600°C (2910°F) and 2500°C (4530°F). Fine silicon particles can be converted to silicon carbide (SiC) by heating in the excess carbon from the organic material.

## production process of silica
Process for the production of precipitated silica A process for the production of a precipitated silica, said process comprising simultaneously adding alkali silicate with a weight modulus SiO 2:alkali oxide=2539:1 and a mineral acid to an initial amount of water, which has been adjusted to a pH value of 70 to 99 or 100 to 107 by the addition

## Ferrosilicon Production | Ferro Silicon Manufacturing Process - ZX 
The SiO 2 content silica used for ferrosilicon production should be more than 97% because the reducing process of SiO2 requires a very high temperature. If with low content of SiO2, the content of Al2O3, and CaO in the silica will relatively high. This requires a higher reaction temperature, which in turn increases the consumption of power and reduces agents.
