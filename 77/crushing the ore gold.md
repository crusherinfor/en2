## Crushing Of The Ore Gold
For most smallscale gold prospectors crushing ore to determine the amount of free gold is the best method to determine gold content within an ore sample Free gold can then be collected using traditional gravity based methods which do not require the same level of permitting as the chemical methods used by commercial gold mines.

## Hand Crushing and Processing Rich Ores - Gold Panning
A slightly different version of mortar and pestle work is a variety called hand stamp crushing. A heavy cylinder of iron is welded to a long rod and placed inside a pipe or tube which is just a bit larger than the diameter of the iron cylinder. This iron cylinder is picked up and dropped onto the ore, much in the manner of the old time stamp mills.

## Rock Crushing Method and Separating Gold From Ores
Gold ore separation uses comminution techniques to break down the excavated rock, but the material hardly looks like a lustrous yellow-orange metal. In order to properly free this rich element from the rock, the crushing stage has to be followed by a chemically active stage, such as the cyanidation process or the carbon in pulp release method.

## How to Effectively Identify the Gold Ore? | Fote Machinery
Identify gold ore by physical properties. （A）Tarnish: Gold nuggets or small pieces of gold are usually bright and free of stains. If you find some rust on the surface of the ore, it is likely to be pyrite. （B）Color: Most native gold is alloyed with silver, and if the silver content is high enough, the ore will have a whitish-yellow color.
