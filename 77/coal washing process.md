Clean coal is an energy that can generally be used as fuel, the fine coal of bituminous coal is generally used for coking. The main reasons of washing coal are as bellow: 1. Improve coal quality and reduce emissions of coal-fired pollutants. Coal washing can remove 50%-80% of ash and 30%-40% of total sulfur (or 60%~80% of inorganic sulfur) in coal.

## How does a coal washery work?sewing
What is the process of coal washing? Coal washing is accomplished by one of two major processes, by density separation or by froth flotation. Both processes depend on the fact that the particles of which a coal sample are made have different densities. When water is added to the sample, particles sink to various depths depending on their densities.
