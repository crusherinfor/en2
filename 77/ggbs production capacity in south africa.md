## What is GGBS? Its Advantages and Disadvantages
What is Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS)? The ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) is a by-product of iron manufacturing which when added to concrete improves its properties such as workability, strength, and durability.. This material is obtained by the heating of the iron ore, limestone, and coke at a temperature of about 1500 o C. The process is carried out in a blast furnace.
