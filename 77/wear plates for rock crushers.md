## What are the Materials of the Jaw Crusher Plates and Which is Better 
Medium carbon low alloy cast steel Medium-carbon low-alloy cast steel is also a widely used wear-resistant material. Due to its high hardness (≥45HRC) and appropriate toughness (≥15J/cm²), it can resist the cutting and repeated extrusion of materials. The fatigue peeling, thus showing good wear resistance.

## JAW PLATES - Precision Casting
Jaw Plates or Jaw Dies are the most frequently replaced wear parts of the jaw crusher, so the quality of the jaw die is one of the most important factors that determine the crushing efficiency and operating time. A set of jaw plates are composed of the movable (swing jaw) and fixed jaw plate (stationary jaw).Compression of material undergoing crushing in a jaw crusher is achieved when the

## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency - Pit & Quarry
The closed-side setting of a jaw crusher helps determine the nip angle within a chamber, typically 19 to 23 degrees. Too large of an angle causes boiling in the crushing chamber. This is where the jaw plates cannot grip onto the rock, and it keeps slipping up and down, avoiding being crushed. The nip angle gets flatter as the machine is set

## Crushing in Mineral Processing
In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing. Depending of the type of rock ( geometallurgy) to be crushed, there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle, compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate
