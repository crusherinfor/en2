## Rate of forest depletion in Ghana alarming - Abu Jinapor
Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, Samuel Abu Jinapor, has expressed grief concern about the depletion of forest covers in Ghana. According to him, in the year, there was an estimated 1900 8,200,000 hectares of forest in Ghana. However, he said, currently, the forest has reduced to 1,600,000 hectares, an 80 percent depletion rate.

## Ghana: Balancing economic growth and depletion of resources
Over the past decade, artisanal gold mining aggravated the degradation as streams and rivers were dug up to find gold. Miners' exposure to the toxic mercury also costs $240 million in health costs. Ghana loses about 2.7 million m 2 of its shore every year, with 80% of the shoreline actively eroding.

Diseases are costly due to mortality (premature death) and morbidity (lower productivity and quality of life). The theory offers three main insights. First, higher disease prevalence implies lower saving-investment propensity. Preventive behavior can partially offset this when the prevalence rate and negative disease externality are relatively low.
