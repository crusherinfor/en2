## Silica sand vs Green sand? - Global Syn-Turf
The only difference between regular silica sand and green sands are the color and price: our green sand is coated with green color which can technically blend in better with the artificial grass. Since the green sands take extra steps of coating and drying, the cost is higher than regular silica sand. Please contact us by phone: 877 796 8873 or

## What is the Best Material to Put Between Flagstone
The smaller sand works better for flagstones that are closer together. The patio we worked with yesterday had gaps anywhere from 1 inch to 6 inches between the stone, so a 1/4 inch gravel really was the best option. This is why I always recommend going with crushed gravel again, it depends on the type of patio and the gaps we have to work with.
