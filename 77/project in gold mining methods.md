## Placer Gold Mining Methods - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Placer Gold Mining Methods. The gold deposits grouped together under the name of " placers " comprise sands, gravels, or any loosely coherent or non-coherent alluvial beds containing gold. They have accumulated owing to the action of running water, in the beds of rivers, or on the adjoining inundation plains, or on sea beaches.

Huge amounts of rock are removed and up to three tons of rock may be required to produce an ounce of gold. This method of mining can be extremely expensive. Underground mining at the Australian Kalgoorlie mines in 1951. Heavy equipment is used to extract gold in underground mines such as the Campbell mine in Ontario, Canada.

Panning. Gold panning is mainly a manual gold separation technique from other materials. Large, shallow pans are filled with gold-containing sand and gravel. The pan is submerged and shaken in water, sorting the gravel gold and other material. It quickly settles down to the bottom of the pan as gold is much denser than rock.

Given the variability in the type, length and cost of mining projects, different measures may favor different projects; therefore the measure to use is not always clear. Table 1 displays the results of a survey in 2002 of the Chief Financial Officers of Fortune 1000 companies, outlining the use of different methods to measure value.

Step #7 - Processing (on-site) Once ore is extracted, processing it into pure gold must be done. Ore is first crushed and then undergoes various processes depending on the nature of associated minerals. Processing low-grade ore is relatively simple while higher grades require more extensive processing.

Mining can directly and indirectly affect social and environmental systems in a range of positive and negative ways, and may result in societal benefits, but may also cause conflicts, not least in relation to land use. Mining always affects the environment, whilst remediation and mitigation efforts may effectively ameliorate some negative environmental impacts.
