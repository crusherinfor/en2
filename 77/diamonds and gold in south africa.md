## Is it cheaper to purchase diamonds in South Africa?
This is not always the case. South African diamond mining is done by large corporations on huge open-casts who sell in bulk. All sales are mediated by the central selling organization De Beers. Pricing of both diamonds and gold is standardized and is in Dollars. The best way to purchase diamonds in South Africa is to find a diamond wholesaler.
