COAL MINE GROUND CONTROL The Coal Mine Roof Rating (CMRR) was developed more than 10 years ago to meet the needs of mine planners for a simple, repeatable, and meaningful classification system [Molinda and Mark 1994]. It employs the familiar format of Bieniawski's RMR, summing the individual ratings to obtain a final CMRR on a 0-100 scale.
