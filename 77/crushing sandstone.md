Figure 4.Vertical Shaft Impactor (VSI). The recommended crushing arrangement to produce the frac sand from sandstone is to install a Jaw Crusher as the primary crusher, followed by a vibratory screen to scalp the small sized material. The coarse materials from the screen are fed to a Vertical Shaft Impactor used as secondary crusher.

Many types of crushed stone: Crushed stone is not a "standardized commodity." It is made by mining one of several types of rock such as limestone, granite, trap rock, scoria, basalt, dolomite, or sandstone; crushing the rock; and then screening the crushed rock to sizes that are suitable for the intended end use.

The best size gravel for a driveway is a minimum of 3/8â€³, which should be large enough to prevent gravel from lodging inside vehicle tire grooves. Smaller gravel sizes are better for sub-bases beneath larger gravel. #57 aggregate or #57 crushed stone is typically used for driveways. How many inches deep should a gravel driveway be?.

Crushed Sandstone primarily used for compaction under roads and in construction. Our Crushed Sandstone comes in 75 mm minus, but often some of the rocks can be a little bigger. The larger rocks in the crushed sandstone are great when you're after a rougher looking finish. For this reason they are not the best suited for pathways.
