HYFOR (Hydrogen-based Fine-Ore Reduction) is a novel direct reduction process for iron ore fines concentrates from ore beneficiation, developed by MHI Group company Primetals Technologies. It builds on fluidized-bed reduction technology, does not require any agglomeration (such as sintering or pelletizing), and uses on 100% hydrogen as a feedstock.

## beneficiation of Low grade iron ore fines - Blogger
These ores subject to beneficiation yield a concentrate containing 61.5 to 66% Fe at 62 to 86% yield. In case of BHQ ore, column flotation technique has been adopted to obtain a concentrate of 66% Fe at 44.7% yield. It has been observed that beneficiation of low grade ores invariably pose specific challenge due to the presence of clayey/earthy
