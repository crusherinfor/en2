A process flow diagram (PFD) is a diagram commonly used in chemical and process engineering to indicate the general flow of plant processes and equipment. The PFD displays the relationship between major equipment of a plant facility and does not show minor details such as piping details and designations. Another commonly-used term for a PFD is a flowsheet.

Before you start mapping out data flow diagrams you need to follow four best practices to create a valid DFD. 1. Each process should have at least one input and one output. 2. Each data store should have at least one data flow in and data flow out. 3. A system's stored data must go through a process. 4.

Figure 1.3 shows that each major piece of process equipment is identified by a number on the diagram. A list of the equipment numbers along with a brief descriptive name for the equipment is printed along the top of the diagram. The location of these equipment numbers and names roughly corresponds to the horizontal location of the corresponding piece of equipment.

Bijan Elahi, in Safety Risk Management for Medical Devices, 2018. 12.7.1.3 Process Flow Diagram. Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) are a graphical way of describing a process, its constituent tasks, and their sequence. A PFD helps with the brainstorming and communication of the process design. The PFMEA process needs a complete list of tasks that comprise the process under analysis.

As long as you and your team members can ultimately reach consensus on the markers and use them consistently across your process flows, they should work just fine. 2.
