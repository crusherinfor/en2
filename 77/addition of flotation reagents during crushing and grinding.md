Grinding is done in closed circuit with classifier. • In many instances, superior flotation is results are obtained by conditioning the ore with the reagents before the flotation step. Oily type collectors are sometimes added to the grinding circuit to ensure dispersion.

The floatation rate of limonite fluctuated between 2.3% and 4.9%, with the increase of the sodium silicate content. Therefore, the addition of sodium silicate can still ensure the effective inhibition of limonite when magnesite is floated and the sodium silicate can be used as an adjusting agent for the flotation separation of two minerals.

## Flotation Reagent - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Coal flotation is commonly carried out with a combination of an oily collector (e.g. fuel oil) and a frother (e.g. MIBC). All coal flotation systems require the addition of a frother to generate small bubbles and to create a stable froth (Table 12.2).Typical addition rates for frothers are in the order of 0.05-0.3 kg of reagent per tonne of coal feed.

## Enhanced cleaner flotation behavior of non-metallic particles in waste 
To study the response of NMPs in different size fractions to flotation reagent dosage, the flotation tests of NMPs of 1-0.5, 0.5-0.25, 0.25-0.125, 0.125-0.074, 0.074-0.045, and −0.045 mm were carried out.  In addition, six flotation kinetic models match the flotation results of NMPs well, and Model 1 is the most suitable for the

## Crushing, Grinding and Concentration of the Ore - Class Notes
1) Crushing and grinding of the ore 2) Concentration or benefaction of the ore 3) Extraction of crude metal from concentrated ore 4) Purification or refining of the metal (1) Crushing and Grinding of the Ore. The ores occur in nature as huge lumps. They are broken to small pieces with the help of crushers or grinders.
