In jaw crusher, the crushing cavity is formed by movable jaw plate and fixed jaw plate. As we know, raw materials are crushed in the crushing cavity, so jaw plates directly contact with the raw material and are easily damaged. In this case, jaw plates are the main wear-resistant parts in jaw crusher and need to be changed regularly.

The materials are pushed inside the chamber from the top opening and when crushed they are released through the bottom opening. The crushing power of the jaw crushers depends on the size of the chamber.

## Selecting the right crusher for your operations - Quarry
Best suited for secondary crushing applications, cone crushers are designed to crush pre-sized materials, usually 100mm, 150mm or 200mm, depending on the size of the crusher. Cone crushers can form finished products down to 12mm or less. Like the jaw crusher, the cone crusher provides a relatively low cost crushing solution, but there are

##  SANDVIK JAW CRUSHER SERIES - Sandvik Mining and Rock Technology
The Sandvik jaw crusher line is designed for the motor sizes listed in RPG and technical specifications. This means that for harder materials, the crusher will have to be operated at larger settings to avoid overload of drive and/or motor. Using oversized motors will lead to radically shorter crusher life and various mechanical problems.

## Jaw Crusher VS Impact Crusher - JXSC Machine
Jaw crusher crushes the materials by squeeze action, therefore the finished product has more needle flake, its particle size is generally 10-350mm. 2. But impact crusher uses impact action to reduce the material size, its finished products are mostly cubes with less needle-like material, finer output particle, and better quality.
