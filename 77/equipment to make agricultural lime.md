Agriculture lime is a type of calcium compound that is used to help neutralize acidic soils. It can easily be applied to the land, preventing the dirt from becoming too acidic. This additive is a calcium carbonate mineral that makes up the bulk of the compounds, while ground gypsum is in small amounts. See more about gypsum on this site.

## Lime kiln
A lime kiln is a kiln used for the calcination of limestone (calcium carbonate) to produce the form of lime called quicklime (calcium oxide).The chemical equation for this reaction is . CaCO 3 + heat → CaO + CO 2. This reaction can take place at anywhere above 840 °C (1544 °F), but is generally considered to occur at 900 °C(1655 °F) (at which temperature the partial pressure of CO 2 is 1

Limestone raises the pH level to a neutral range beneficial to plants, typically between 5.5 and 6.5. If the pH is acidic and below 5.5, or if the pH is alkaline and above 6.5, this will create a nutrient deficiency in your plants. You can improve the nutritional quality of your crops by using limestone in the recommended amount.

## Applying lime | Agriculture and Food
The main aim when applying lime to the surface should be an even coverage of the ground. The spreading width should be approximately 6-8 metres (m) (depending on wind conditions) to get good coverage of fine particles (less than 0.5 millimetres (mm)). Spreading too wide results in uneven treatment of soil acidity.

## Considerations For Liming No-Till Fields
A general guideline for lime applications in no-till is: half the rate, twice as often. This depends on several factors. A coarse-textured soil with a low CEC does not require a lot of lime to correct soil pH, but may need to be limed frequently. A finer-textured soil with a high CEC requires a large amount of lime to initially correct pH, but

Lime Recommendations. Limestone recommendations are made based on the pH goal and the amount of exchangeable acidity measured by the Mehlich Buffer soil test. The pH goal varies with the crop. The pH goal is given on the crop sheet for each crop in this handbook. If the soil pH is already at or above the pH goal, no limestone is recommended.

Mar 16, 2022Agricultural lime is the safest type of lime for recreational fish ponds and aquaculture ponds. Also referred to as agricultural limestone, garden lime, or aglime, this type of lime is made by breaking up limestone to create a finely pulverized material. It is chiefly composed of calcium carbonate.

Ag Lime promotes this action, allowing these bacteria to flourish and thereby allowing legumes maximum nitrogen fixation. Soil at proper pH levels tends to foster stronger root systems. Plants growing in neutral soil typically put down more extensive root systems that are more finely divided. This allows them to absorb nutrients more efficiently.

Ag Lime, or agricultural lime, is a soil conditioner made from crushed limestone or dolomitic limestone. Ag Lime works by dissolving and releasing a base that lowers the acidity of the soil. For crops growing in less-than-ideal acidity conditions, aglime can boost a farmer's profit potential by providing a number of benefits, including

For wheat and bermudagrass, the soil pH must be raised above 5.5, so a half ton (25% of the soil test deficiency amount needed to bring the soil up to a pH of 6.8) is ideal. In the case of legumes, soil pH must be brought up to 6.8. For surface liming, up to 2.5 tons can be applied per acre per year, with up to 4 tons for tilled soil.

The Lime law was actually amended in 1996 to include "by-product" limes. By-product limes are any material other than Ag limestone that can be used as a liming source, for example wood ash and lime mud. Most by-products do not have as high a CCE as ag limestone and therefore require higher rates of application.
