## Factors affect the operation and running of vertical roller mill
Particle size of raw material. Vertical mills have a certain range of requirements for the particle size of the raw materials. If the feeding size is too large, the primary grinding efficiency will be reduced, the number of cycles of the material will increase, and the grinding power consumption of the mill will be increased invisibly.

Ball milling was performed for 24 hours at 1000 rpm. With this pre-treatment, the resulting nanocrystals had a spherical shape with a nm diameter and a 3-7 nm height, rather than a rod-like shape. This demonstrated that the applied pre-treatment was a determining factor in the morphology and particle size of the resulting CNCs.

The ball mill rotates on its horizontal axis so that the media cascades causing size reduction by impact and sheer forces. Feed material size for ball mills is usually less than 1 in., and they are effective to produce a particle size range of 5-500µ, in some cases as fine as 1µ, but this is usually the limit.
