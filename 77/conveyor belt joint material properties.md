Carcass. The carcass is the most important part of a conveyor belt, as it has to absorb the tensile stresses imposed on the belt to convey the material and to comply with all mechanical and thermal requirements. The purpose of the rubber covers is to protect the carcass. The quality of the covers depends on the application of the conveyor belt.
