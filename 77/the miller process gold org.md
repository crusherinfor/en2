Leaching of gold and silver from the Miller Process dross was investigated using non-cyanide leachants. The dross was found to be very refractory to direct leaching with thiourea as well as thiosulphate. Thiourea leaching of the calcined dross resulted in about 84% extraction of gold, but the leaching of silver was very poor.

## Gold Refiners in NZ: Unmatched Gold Quality and Wide Inventory
The Wohlwill process and Miller process are the most popular gold refining methods for extracting pure gold. The Miller process makes use of gaseous chlorine to remove impurities once gold reaches its melting point. The impurities separate to create a layer along the molten gold's surface. This is a fairly straightforward and quick process

There are two main methods of refining gthe Wohlwill process or the Miller process. The Wohlwill process was invented in 1875 by Emil Wohlwill and produces g to a high degree of purity (99.999 percent). The Wohlwill process is an electrochemical process. The Miller process produces a slightly lower purity of g, only 99.95 percent pure.

The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold. The Miller process is rapid and simple, but it produces gold of only about 99.5 percent purity. The Wohlwill process increases purity to about 99.99 percent by electrolysis.
