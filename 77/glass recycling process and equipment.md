## Solar Panel Recycling | US EPA
An ideal recycling system would recover as much material from solar panels as possible. There are different methods to recycle solar panels, which can include some or all of the following three steps: Removal of the frame and junction box; Separation of the glass and the silicon wafer through thermal, mechanical or chemical processes; and/or.

## The Glass Recycling Process | How is Glass Recycled? - Gaskells
Glass recycling, or glass reprocessing, is the process of turning waste glass back into usable products. This involves washing, crushing and melting used glass before moulding it back into bottles and jars. This cycle can be repeated endlessly with no loss in quality to the end product. Glass manufacturers in the UK recycle almost 70% of all

## Dispelling the myths surrounding glass recycling
Another part of the high-cost myth is the notion that glass recycling is very hard on the equipment used to process it and so is expensive in terms of replacements and repair of machinery and systems. Bucey says this is just not true. He says, again, maybe for the MRF of 15 years ago this might have been true.
