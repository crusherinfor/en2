While traditional concrete normally has a compressive strength ranging anywhere from 2,500 to 5,000 psi, UHPC can have a compressive strength of up to 10 times that of traditional concrete. After just 14 days of curing, UHPC has a compressive strength of 20,000 psi. This number increases to 30,000 psi when fully cured for 28 days.

## Marble Rock: Geology, Properties, Uses - ThoughtCo
Marble is a metamorphic rock formed when limestone is subjected to high pressure or heat. In its pure form, marble is a white stone with a crystalline and sugary appearance, consisting of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Usually, marble contains other minerals, including quartz, graphite, pyrite, and iron oxides.These minerals can give marble a pink, brown, gray, green, or variegated coloration.
