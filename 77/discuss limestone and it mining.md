It is very similar to the impact of mining. 2. Larger Environmental Damage. Limestone quarrying as a process has its carbon footprint. The transport of limestone quarried leads to more environmental degradation. All uses of limestone have varying but some adverse impact on the environment.

Limestone in powdered form is also used as a substance to absorb pollutants or control coal mine dust at many coal-mining facilities. Lime which is the byproduct of limestone is used to neutralise acids and treat wastewater, industrial sludge, animal waste, and water supplies. These are some popular uses of limestone.

Limestone mining began in Florida during the First Spanish Period. In 1672, construction began on the Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine. Locally mined coquina was used. This is the oldest masonry fort in the continental United States. In 1753, construction began on a limestone fort in St. Marks to replace older wooden structures.

## Limestone: Rock Uses, Formation, Composition, Pictures - Geology
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.

Large charges reduce whole areas of limestone to rubble, which is removed for use as crushed stone. The noise, dust, and impact from explosions can result in noise pollution and dust.

Limestone is a producer of quicklime and slaked lime. It is widely used for the production of Portland cement and mortar. Limestone is burnt to create lime, along with other raw materials ash, and sand. Together, they form a product called clinker. Clinker is then mixed with gypsum and crushed to form a powdery mixture.
