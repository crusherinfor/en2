## Sheet glass manufacture: the float process - IELTS reading practice test
Sheet glass manufacture: the float process. Glass, which has been made since the time of the Mesopotamians and Egyptians, is little more than a mixture of sand, soda ash and lime. When heated to about 1500 degrees Celsius (°C) this becomes a molten mass that hardens when slowly cooled. The first successful method for making clear, flat glass

Lead glass (commonly known as lead crystal) is used to make a wide variety of decorative glass objects. It is made by using lead oxide instead of limestone, and potassium carbonate (potash) instead of the sodium carbonate (soda ash). Lead Oxide. There are many other types of specialty glass formulae, using ingredients other than lead or lime.

## How Glass is Made from Lighting Striking Sand
In order for it to happen, lightning has to strike sand and heat it up to about 1,800 degrees Celsius in under a second. When the circumstances are just right, the lightning will fuse a bunch of sand together and turn it into silica glass. It'll also send energy radiating through the ground to create hollow glass tubes that are called fulgurites.

Sand melts into a liquid state at around 1700˚ C (or 30390˚ F)! In a commercial glass plant, sand is mixed with cullet (recycled glass pieces), soda ash and limestone and is then heated. The soda helps reduce the sand's melting point which helps reduce the overall energy—and cost—needed to melt it. The by-product of adding the soda is

## Glass Sand - CDE Asia
There is not one specification for glass sand as a result of the many different types of glass that can be produced. Each glass has differing chemical and physical properties which require the use of different glass sands. Most of the commercial glass in everyday use is soda-lime-silica glass. These contain between 70% and 74% silicon dioxide
