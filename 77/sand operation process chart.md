## Surface Roughness Chart & Useful Information - EngineeringClicks
The surface roughness chart is a concept that expresses the amount and extent of deviation of a surface from being perfectly flat. As it is practically impossible to manufacture a completely flat surface on the microscopic level, every surface has a certain value of roughness that can be measured with the use of a profilometer.Depending on the scale of the deviations and the roughness

Flow Process Chart: A flow process chart is a chart showing the sequence of the flow of a product by way of recording all activities/events under review with appropriate symbols. This chart is similar to operation process chart with the difference that it utilizes symbols of operation, transportation, inspection, delay and permanent storage.

## Oil sands | Suncor
Oil sands process and production. Oil sand is a mixture of bitumen, sand, clay and water. Because it does not flow like conventional crude oil which is a liquid, it must be mined or heated underground before it can be processed. Once the bitumen has been extracted, we upgrade it into higher-value synthetic crude oil, diesel fuel and other products.

Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. Casting materials include metal, concrete, epoxy, plaster, and clay. This article will focus on sand casting. The versatility of the sand casting process is well recognized.
