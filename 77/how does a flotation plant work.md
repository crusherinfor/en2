## Froth flotation
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic. This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.

Buoyancy. The basic physics behind flotation devices is that they add buoyancy to the person using them in the water. When a person is in the water, there is an upward force acting on them from the water and a downward force from the weight of the person. If the person floats, the downward force is less than the upward force from the water, and
