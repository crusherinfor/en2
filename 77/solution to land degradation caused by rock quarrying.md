Nine Main Causes of Land Degradation are as follows: 1. Deforestation: Forests play an important role in maintaining fertility of soil by shedding their leaves which contain many nutrients. Forests are also helpful in binding up of soil particles with the help of roots of vegetation. Therefore, cutting о forests will affect the soil adversely.

## 6 Causes of Land Degradation
One of the biggest causes of land degradation is overgrazing. Overgrazing occurs when animals such as cattle, goats, sheep, etc feed on the grass excessively. The more animals feed on the grass of a parcel of land, the more the quality of the land is reduced. The grass soon stops growing on that parcel of land and it also becomes infertile.

Quarrying is the cutting or digging of stone, and related materials, from an excavation site or pit and it usually leaves behind a large hole in the ground. An ore is a deposit containing an economically viable amount of a mineral, which itself is a crystalline inorganic compound, usually containing a metal. It is the metal that is of value.

In turn, many farmers may lose their livelihood, since they often solely rely on farming as their single source of income.
