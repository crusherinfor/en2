## Scientists look to remove CO2 from atmosphere by accelerating natural 
If it weren't for silicate weathering, Earth would be a hot, almost Venus-like hellscape. Carbon dioxide mixes with rain and causes the weathering, or breakdown, of rocks. This sets in motion chemical reactions that remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it as minerals hidden away on the ocean floor.
