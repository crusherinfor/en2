Aggregate is fed onto the high end of the top deck and the vibration causes the aggregate to jiggle down the screen until it either drops through a mesh aperture or falls off the end of a deck. The aggregate is then sorted or 'screened' according to the mesh sizes fitted, from large aperture mesh at the top, to small aperture mesh at the bottom.

Sand and gravel quarries are pumped to allow them to be worked dry or operated as lakes with extraction below water. A conveyor draws raw material into the processing plant, where it is washed to remove unwanted clay and to separate sand. Sand separated during processing is dewatered and stockpiled.

## 3. The Environmental Impacts of Aggregate Extraction | Toronto 
Aggregate is mined from the earth, either dug out of pits or blasted out of quarries. This process has many significant environmental impacts. [1] Creating the pits or quarries requires the removal of virtually all natural vegetation, top soil and subsoil to reach the aggregate underneath. Not only does this lead to a loss of existing animal
