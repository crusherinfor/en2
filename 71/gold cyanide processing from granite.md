## Can gold miners say 'sayonara' to cyanide? - Canadian Mining Journal
The company is targeting small to medium scale miners that can't afford a conventional cyanide plant or want to avoid using cyanide. According to CSIRO, the cost of a typical cyanide-based processing plant is around $30 million, but the new technology, which is scalable, can cost as little as $2-2.5 million.

## How to Extract Refractory Gold Ore Using Gold Recovery Cyanide Process?
Gold recovery cyanide process is widely used. A professional gold recovery industry that handles high-sulfur, high-arsenic, and other refactory gold concentrates, the arsenic grade is about 10%. The high-sulfur and high-arsenic gold concentrate is pretreated by two-stage roasting, and the two-stage roasting sand is leached into the gold recovery cyanide process by sulfuric acid leaching.

This wasn't the first time Cache Creek suffered for the placer gold washed down its banks. The area, named for its 150-year placer mining history, was the site of logging and intensive gold prospecting from the mid-1800s. Major operations ended in 1911. The ravaged land was gradually reclaimed by nature, only to be overrun again a century later.

## cyanide in gold processing
Role of cyanide in ore processing Cyanide, in the form of a very dilute sodium cyanide solution, is used to dissolve and separate gold from ore. [3] The process used to extract gold using cyanide was developed in Scotland in 1887, and was first used in large scale commercial mining by the New Zealand Crown Mines Company at Karangahake in 1889.

## Gold Cyanidation: Process & Environmental Impacts | Study
Since most ores only contain 0.001% gold or silver (by mass), back in 1887 a clever human in Scotland discovered that using dilute amounts of cyanide (in the form of sodium cyanide) can aid in the

increase in gold and silver recoveries between 0.4-1.2% for gold and 3.9-11.6% for silver at the end of 24 hours leaching by the addition of lead nitrate as 0.1-0.5 kg/Mg. NaCN consumption decreased or did not change except for the Ovacik ore. In the case of the Ovacik ore it slightly increased. Keywords: lead nitrate, gold, silver, cyanide
