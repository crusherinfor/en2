## Recovering Gold through the Froth Flotation Process
Pre-19th century placer mining operations used mercury to dissolve the gold in crushed ore, making it easier to recover. Later innovations include the MacArthur-Forrest Process and borax flux extraction. However, one of the most interesting methods is froth flotation. Froth flotation works by exploiting the hydrophobic properties of gold molecules.

## Copper extraction
For oxide ores, a hydrometallurgical liberation process is normally undertaken, which uses the soluble nature of the ore minerals to the advantage of the metallurgical treatment plant. For sulfide ores, both secondary ( supergene ) and primary ( hypogene ), froth flotation is used to physically separate ore from gangue.

## Froth flotation
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.  The chain is shortest in sodium ethyl xanthate that makes it highly selective to copper, nickel, lead, gold, and zinc ores. Aqueous solutions (10%) with pH=7-11 are normally used in the process.

When floatability difference happens to the various nickel elements in the raw ore, the nickel ore can be recycled from tailings after the copper and nickel did the mixing flotation. Copper- Nickel Ore Flotation Process: A basic principle of copper-sulfide nickel ore process is that it is better to let the coppers assimilate into the nickel ore.

The standard cyanide leach process consists of grinding the ore to about. 80% - 200 mesh, mixing the ore/water grinding slurry with about 2 pounds. per ton of sodium cyanide and enough quick lime to keep the pH of the solution. at about 11.0. At a slurry concentration of 50% solids, the slurry passes.
