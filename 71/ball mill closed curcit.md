Capacity. 1-1120t/h. Output size. 10-350mm. Ball mill is a type of grinder machine which uses steel ball as grinding medium, can crush and grind the materials to 35 mesh or finer, adopted in open or close circuit. The feed materials can be dry or wet, they are broken by the force of impact and attrition that created by the different sized balls.

In this example the ball mill circuit classification system efficiency is 77.1 per cent at 75 μs. This means that  (P80 = 25 μ) pebble milling circuit closed with hydrocyclones historically operated at a circulating load ratio of about 180 per cent. A plant test, with the

## Difference Between Closed Circuit And Open Circuit Cement Mill
Ball mill open or closed circuit o started as an open circuit mill until cpb introduced the 1st air separator in 1939 for closed circuit grinding o years of development led to a highly reliable, flexible amp easy to operate plant, requiring simple, low maintenance with readily available wear parts and low stocking cost.
