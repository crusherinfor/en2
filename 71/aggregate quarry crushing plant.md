Please note that Gravel Tech does NOT haul, sell, or deliver any gravel at all. We do however, provide the labor and equipment necessary to restore a gravel driveway using the existing driveway material.. The formula gravel pits use to calculate required tonnage for a 3" application is: Length x Width x Depth x 100 ÷ 2000 . eg: 600' x 10'x .25ft (or 3") = 1500.
