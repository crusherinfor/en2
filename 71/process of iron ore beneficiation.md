## Treatment and Recycling of the Process Water in Iron Ore  - Hindawi
In order to ensure iron concentrate grade and iron recovery, a large number of processing reagents are selected and applied in the iron ore beneficiation. The process water carried plenty of residual processing reagents, and such wastewater with color depth and strong smell could seriously affect the environment and the local people.

## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

Iron ore is the basic raw material for iron and steel making. India is among the leading producers of iron ore in the world and produces about 150 million tons per annum (U. S. []).The total reserves of iron ore in India is around 28.5 billion tons, of this hematite ore is considered to be the most important iron ore because of its high grade quality and lumpy nature.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
Beneficiation of Iron Ores. Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel. The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron, hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron. magnetite). Ores are normally associated with unwanted gangue material. Grade of iron ore is usually determined by the total

## Beneficiation
Beneficiation. In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step

## A short review on environmental impacts and application of iron ore 
One such waste which is generated during the beneficiation process of iron ore is waste iron ore tailings, which is also termed as IOT. Further, dumping of IOT on open ground creates huge dumping sites. This dumping sites have been a concern to the environment and human population in its close vicinity. Therefore, a need to effectively use IOT
