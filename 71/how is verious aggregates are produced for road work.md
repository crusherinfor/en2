## Using Recycled Concrete as Aggregate - Civil Engineering Notes
To use recycled concrete as aggregate for concrete contaminants like reinforcing, steel foundation, materials soil etc are removed from the concrete debris. It can be done by screening, air-separation, demolition using electromagnets. Then the debris is crushed either manually or mechanically. It in done in specified size and quality usually

The coarse aggregates obtained by different crushing mechanisms (jaw and impact crushers) show very similar characteristics in terms of binder content assessed by acid leaching (27.5 and 26.6 wt.%), water absorption (8.76 and 9.75 wt.%) and porosity (18.6 and 20.2 vol.%).Thus, it is not possible to conclude that any of these mechanisms are more efficient in removing the cement paste attached

7. There are various types of aggregates. Primary aggregates are raw materials that are quarried from the land or dredged from the sea, and can be classified as either crushed rock, or sand and gravel. Secondary aggregates are produced as the by-products of other industrial or mining activities. Recycled aggregates are derived. Get Price

Aggregates are the most basic material used in construction. They provide the foundation for roads, bridges, and buildings, while also making up over 90% of an asphalt pavement and up to 80% of a concrete mix. On average, 38,000 tons of aggregates are necessary to construct one lane mile of interstate highway.

Aggregate " is a collective term for the mineral materials such as sand, gravel and crushed stone that are used with a binding medium (such as water, bitumen, portland cement, lime, etc.) to form compound materials (such as asphalt concrete and portland cement concrete). By volume, aggregate generally accounts for 92 to 96 percent of HMA and about 70 to 80 percent of portland cement concrete.

## An Investigation Into Quality of Aggregate in Road Construction
4. To determine the aggregate abrasion resistance and breakdown of particles and tests that address aggregate weathering when exposed to freezing and thawing. 5. To determine the different properties of aggregates. 6. To examine the different quality plan or system to controlling the sources of aggregate. 1.3 SCOPE OF THE STUDY

## Artificial Aggregate - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Ian Sims, Bev Brown, in Lea's Chemistry of Cement and Concrete (Fourth Edition), 1998. By-products and manufactured aggregates. Many artificial aggregates are either controlled, by-products of industrial processes, such as the various slags, or uncontrolled waste materials resulting from other industrial processes, such as clinkers and ashes. Another important source of waste material is the
