## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
Instead of disposing them in landfills, it can be best utilized as partial replacement to sand. In crusher dust, the particles (% finer than 150 microns) are generally high, a major concern limiting its percentage replacement to minimum with sand in a concrete mix. It can be replaced to the amount 25%. Its Availability is not a concern.
