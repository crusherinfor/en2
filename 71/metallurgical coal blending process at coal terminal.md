## Building a Coal Terminal on the West Coast | Coal Age
It would do little good to build a coal terminal up a shallow river that could only be served by Panamax vessels on a high tide, yet that may have contributed to the early demise of the Port of Portland coal terminal. There were other contributing factors, such as very long rail distances and resultant high rail rates.

## Coal Blending - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Many coal blending theories have been proposed for producing coke of a specific targeted quality by blending various kinds of coals. For example, Jo (1965) considered that coal consists of two components, a fibrous component and a caking component, and that increasing the strength of fibrous component (coal rank) and the addition of a suitable amount of caking component (caking property) are

## What is Mixing and Blending? What are Mixers, Blenders, or Agitators?
The terms "mixing" and "blending" are often used interchangeably, but technically they are slightly different. Blending is a process of combining materials, but blending is a relatively gentle process compared to mixing. In terms of the phase of material, blending is the process of solid-solid mixing or mixing of bulk solids with small

## Beira coal terminal - Global Energy Monitor
Background. Brazilian mining giant Vale, the first major company to start producing thermal and metallurgical coal from the Tete basin, reported in August 2011 that it delivered its first coal by train from its Moatize mine project to the Beira port. Between August 2011 and January 2012, Vale exported 246,000 metric tons of coal using Beira port's pre-existing infrastructure.
