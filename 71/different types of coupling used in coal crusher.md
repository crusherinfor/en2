There are four major types (or "ranks") of coal. Rank refers to steps in a slow, natural process called "coalification," during which buried plant matter changes into an ever denser, drier, more carbon-rich, and harder material. The four ranks are: Anthracite: The highest rank of coal. It is a hard, brittle, and black lustrous coal, often referred to as hard coal, containing a high

The primary coal crushers may be of different types such as: (1) coal jaw, (2) coal hammer, and (3) ring granulator. Secondary coal crusher: Used when the coal coming from the supplier is large enough to be handled by a single crusher. The primary crusher converts the feed size to one that is acceptable to the secondary crusher.

Definition: The power plant that is used to warm the water to generate steam, then this steam can be used for rotating huge turbines for generating electricity. These plants use the heat to warm the water which is generated by nuclear fission. So the atoms in the nuclear fission will split into different smaller atoms for generating energy.
