## How Many Types Of Coal Are There - Realonomics
There are four types of coal - peat lignite bituminous and anthracite. What are the 3 types of coal mines? The three main types of surface coal mining are strip mining open-pit mining and mountaintop removal (MTR) mining. Strip mining is used where coal seams are located very near the surface and can be removed in massive layers or strips.

It is a type of fossil fuel created from the remains of dead plants many years ago. It has been classified as a nonrenewable energy source.  coal is used indirectly to make steel. What happens here is that coal is baked in furnaces to form coal coke. Once this is formed, manufacturers use coal coke to smelt iron ore into iron and make steel.

## Coking Coal for steel production and alternatives
By Noah Beecher Kelk Metallurgical coal, also called metcoal or coking coal, is a type of coal that is used in the production of steel. It is of a higher purity than thermal coal which is used in energy generation. To make steel, metcoal is heated at around 1100 degrees C to remove water and other chemicals. This is done without the presence of oxygen. The result is a lump of near-pure carbon

## What Are The Different Types Of Coal - Realonomics
The most significant uses of coal are in electricity generation steel production cement manufacturing and as a liquid fuel. Steam coal - also known as thermal coal - is mainly used in power generation. Coking coal - also known as metallurgical coal - is mainly used in steel production. What are the six types of coal?

If available it can also be used as source of heat in various furnaces. By product fuels in the steel plant are namely (i) coke oven (CO) gas, (ii) blast furnace (BF) gas, (iii) converter gas, (iv) coal tar fuel, and finer fractions of coke (nut coke and coke breeze). Coke oven gas is a rich gas and has a calorific value ranging between 4000 to
