## Impact Crusher - Afuruika
The impact crusher is a crushing machine that uses impact energy to crush the material. When the machine is working, driven by the motor, the rotor rotates at a high speed. When the material enters the plate hammer impact zone, it impacts and breaks with the plate hammer on the rotor. It is thrown again on the counterattack device and broken

An impact wrench stores kinetic energy in a rotating hammer, which is forced impacted against an anvil which then imparts force to the driver. Since this force is delivered upon impact in a short burst rather than continuously, the torque is multiplied. Regular sockets simply cannot take the abuse of air-powered devices.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
