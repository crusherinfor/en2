## Lime and Dolime | The Artesia Companies
Dolime or dolomitic lime (calcium & magnesium oxide) is the result of the chemical transformation of double carbonate of calcium and magnesium by heating it above 900°C, which requires energy (2.935 GJ/t CaO.MgO). Like lime, dolime reacts with water. CaO's affinity for water is higher than that of MgO.

## Lime stabilization of clay minerals and soils - ScienceDirect
In fact, the amount of lime added should be related to the clay mineral content of the soil. According to Ingles (1987) a good rule of thumb in practice is to allow 1% by weight of lime for each 10% of clay in the soil. Exact prescriptions can be made after tests at and slightly to each side of this value.

For example, the AEV of soft soil is approximately 2000 kPa, lime-stabilized soil is approximately 3059 kPa, and the addition of 4% RHA into lime-stabilized soil resulted in an AEV of 7980 kPa. The increase in the AEV of RHA-lime stabilized soil is approximately 295% and 157% compared to that of soft soil and lime-stabilized soil, respectively.
