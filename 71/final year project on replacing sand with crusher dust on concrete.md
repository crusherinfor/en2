The small plate compactor is mainly used for tamping foundation and asphalt road surface. It is suitable for material with low adhesion and friction between particles. The powerful impact force of the small compactor is driven by high-speed rotation of the engine, and transmitted from the belt to the body by the automatic clutch. In addition, we also have mini road rollers, concrete trowel.

Choices are between sand, crusher dust and clay. I can get the crusher dust the cheapest because of a friend at the rock quarry, but is it suitable for compaction. Sand is the better option. It is the least reactive to moisture of the three choices. Crusher dust and clay are more difficult to compact.
