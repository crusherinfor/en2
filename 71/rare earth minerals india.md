## Carbonatite Rare Earth Elements Deposits - Geology for Investors
Introduction. Carbonatites are a special group of carbonate-rich igneous rocks and the world's primary source of rare earth elements (REE), niobium, zirconium, and phosphate oxide. They contain more than 50% primary carbonate minerals, less than 20% silicate minerals (pyroxene, amphibole, and olivine), and few phosphate minerals.

India however produces less than 2% of the total Rare Earth (RE)Oxide produced globally. This disparity highlights an underutilization of resources and at the same time, merely selling the oxides might not be the best strategy across all the rare earth elements. In India, certain REs are present in much larger quantities than others.

Rare earth minerals are a highly valued commodity. China currently controls 80% of the world's resources and refines most of the rare earth minerals mined in the world. This in and of itself is not an issue unless rare earth minerals become politicalized, which occasionally they do. In 2010 China restricted rare earth mineral shipments to Japan.

## Rare earth metals are used extensively in clean energy technologies 
Despite the name, rare earth elements are found abundantly in the Earth's crust. They are widely dispersed and found in low concentrations that are not economically exploitable.  Until 1948, India and Brazil were the world's primary producers of rare earth metals. The countries with the most rare earth metals currently are China (the
