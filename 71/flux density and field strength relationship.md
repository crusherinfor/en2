## Difference Between Magnetic Field & Magnetic Flux - Circuit Globe
The most significant difference between the magnetic field and the magnetic flux is that the magnetic field is the region around the magnet where the moving charge experiences a force, whereas the magnetic flux shows the quantity or strength of magnetic lines produced by the magnet. The other differences between the magnetic field and magnetic flux are explained below in the comparison chart.

## Difference between surface Gauss, remanence and pull strength
When a Gauss rating is displayed this can either be a measure of open circuit flux density or closed circuit flux density, which is also referred to as remanence. In essence, they are both measurements of the number of lines of magnetism in every cm2, but in different conditions. Magnets in open circuit rarely exceed a Gauss value of 7,000 Gauss.

Electric flux density, which refers to the amount of charge passing through an area, is a measure of how fast charge can pass through an area. A flux of electric fields is the amount of electric energy that flows through a given area.

In magnetism, several physical quantities such as magnetic flux, magnetic flux density and magnetic field strength are used to explain the behaviors or influences of magnetic fields.Some people use these terms interchangeably. But they have different and particular meanings.

## Relation between "Magnetic Field Strength" and "Magnetic Flux Density 
When I look at the calculated fields in .vtu files, I find that "Magnetic Flux Density" is essentially "Magnetic Field Strength" times (Pi  1E-7). This does not look right because B = mu_rmu_0H, mu_0= 4Pi1E-7 H/m, and my mu_r=1. It appears that "Magnetic Flux Density" has correct values in units of Tesla, while "Magnetic
