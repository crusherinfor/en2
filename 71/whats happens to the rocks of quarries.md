This is a list of notable quarries and areas of quarrying in the United States. A number of these are historic quarries listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), ranging from relatively ancient archeological sites to places having pre-World War II activity. This includes major areas of continuing, modern quarrying. According to Marble, in 2016 there were 276 quarries

Sources of construction materials come and go, but rock quarries and their associated products like sand and gravel have been around for centuries. Used in concrete, roads, landscaping, drain fields, fills, foundations, and even hourglasses, aggregate demand for sand and gravel has been a source of constant activity for surface mines and other quarries.

## Why is it that water in a rock quarry is always super blue?
When the quarry is finished, the pumps are turned off and the water flows back in. When the water is exposed to the air, the CO2 degasses. This allows the pH to rise and for Calcium Carbonate to precipitate. The CaCO3 is very finely crystalline and remains suspended in the water column giving it that "Bahamian" blue color.

##  No Longer Just a Hole in the Ground The Adaptive Re-Use of  - MIT
A quarry is an area from which rocks such as marble, limestone, and granite are extracted for industrial use. Once depleted of their desired resources, quarries are frequently abandoned. The resulting gaping holes can fill with water and form dangerous quarry lakes while others are turned into unsightly landfills.
