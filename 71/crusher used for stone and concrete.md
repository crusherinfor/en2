## 3 Reasons Why It's Important To Use Crushed Stone Under Concrete Slabs
Proper Drainage. Because concrete is a very porous material, it will absorb any moisture that it contacts. This can cause pooling. Without crushed stone, pooling water will settle under it and erode your slab. Adding a layer of crushed stone will add proper drainage, as well as create a barrier between your slab and the ground.

What is Crusher Run and Why is It Used? (Also Called: Crush and Run) Crusher run is a blended mix of coarse aggregate and fine aggregate. The combination of both crushed stone and stone dust creates a low void content (the amount of space or air between the pieces of rock in a mix) that is valuable in concrete construction for its compaction ability and drainage characteristics.

A crusher is a machine that uses mechanical energy to break blocks of stone, concrete, or other building materials into smaller blocks of a specific grain size. They are particularly used in the mining industry to reduce the size of ore blocks and facilitate their processing. Crushers are designed to receive blocks of a maximum size.
