Description. Commonly called fool's gold, pyrite is the Earth's most abundant sulfide mineral. Recognized for its brass-yellow color which resembles that of gold, pyrite is a source of iron and sulfur and is used for the production of sulfuric acid. Some types of pyrite contain enough microscopic gold to warrant mining them as a gold ore.

May 01, 2014· In some ways, the sulphide mineral pyrite has the opposite problem to galena. Composed of iron and sulphur, pyrite can contaminate ground water and streams via tailings waste from mines. Oxidation of pyrite releases toxic metals and metalloids such as arsenic, a poisonous element. Coal veins often contain pyrite with arsenic.
