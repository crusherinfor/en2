Gyratory crushers are similar in shape and operation to cone crushers. However, their moving crushing components gyrate (i.e., oscillate along a circular path) rather than rotate. The crushing head can be height-adjusted, and the hole at the bottom of the crushing chamber determines the final size of the crushed material. Stone Crushers

## Impact vs cone crushers: Which is more effective? - Quarry
The smaller the output size, the more competitive impact crushers become because their percentage of finished product in the first pass is considerably higher than cone crushers. Combined with an upgrade to wear parts materials, this can allow impact crushers to reach a lower wear-cost ratio (per tonne) than cone crushers (see Table 1).

## Hydraulic Cone Crusher, Stone and Construction Waste Crushing
Hydraulic Cone Crusher. The cone crusher integrates mechanical, hydraulic, electrical, automatic and intelligent control, and adopts the principle of layer compression crushing, which is able to crush hard materials such as masonry and stone in construction and decoration waste to a small size, and the finished product is of high quality, with a cubic shape and high content of fine particles

## Cone Crusher Explained - saVRee
The spring cone crusher design is able to pass uncrushable materials e.g. tramp metal, through the crushing cavity by using springs. The first hydraulic cone crusher was developed in 1948 and this allowed for the opening of the crushing cavity hydraulically, instead of using springs (mechanical actuation).

## Cone crusher requirements for crushed materials
3. The fineness of the material after the cone is crushed: the fineness requirement is high, that is, the finer the crushed material, the smaller the crushing capacity. This aspect depends on the specific requirements. If there is no special requirement, the material is generally The fineness can be set to medium fine. 4.
