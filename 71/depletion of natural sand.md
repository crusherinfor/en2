## The Pros and Cons of Manufactured Sand - The Screed Scientist®
Global scarcity for natural sand: Injudicious sand mining and continuous depletion of natural aggregate sources have led to the implementation of new environmental/land use legislations which has made the procurement of natural sand difficult and expensive. Sand dredging is heavily taxed/ banned in many parts of the world.

## Sand Extraction: 1. Introduction - GreenFacts
Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.

## What Does Sand Come From - Realonomics
What Does Sand Come From? Sand forms when rocks break down from weathering and eroding over thousands and even millions of years. Rocks take time to decompose especially quartz (silica) and feldspar. Often starting thousands of miles from the ocean rocks slowly travel down rivers and streams constantly breaking down along the way.
