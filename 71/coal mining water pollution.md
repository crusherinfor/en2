## 12 Environmental Effects of Coal Mining - Environment 911
Possibly one of the scariest environmental effects of coal mining is the threat of acid rain. The high acidity of AMD remains in the water supply even through evaporation and condensation, which enables it to stay in the atmosphere and eventually return in the form of "acid rain," thus perpetuating the cycle of pollution.

## U.S. Waterways Polluted by Coal Mining - Environmental Pollution Centers
The main problem of the coal mining process is the pollution of the nearby waterways by that which is brought to the surface from a coal mine alongside with the extraction of coal. Generally, along with coal comes acidic water carrying arsenic, copper and lead, an occurrence also known as acid mine drainage.

About one quarter of coal mined in South Africa is exported, most of which leaves the country via Richards Bay. In South Africa, and particularly in the province of Mpumalanga, large-scale coal mining operations also have an increasing negative impact on the country's water quality and availability.

Mine drainage is metal-rich water formed from a chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. The resulting chemicals in the water are sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can come out as solids to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage.
