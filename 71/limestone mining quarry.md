Limestone quarrying began in the early 1800's and continues today. Small amounts of impure limestone have been quarried in many parts of the state, but the only place that has produced a significant amount of lime is the Rockland-Thomaston area.  The mining of feldspar, used as an ingredient in ceramics, began in Topsham in 1852 and expanded

## Where Is Limestone Mined - Realonomics
Limestone is most often mined from a quarry. However underground limestone mines are found at places in the central and eastern United States especially in and near cities. Underground mining of lime- stone has some advantages over surface quarrying and will probably increase in the future.
