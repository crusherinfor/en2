## grinding machine theory
A grinding machine which is popularly known as a grinder is a power tool or machine tool used for grinding. Just as other machine tools, it is a type of machining process that uses an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool. The abrasive grain on the wheel's surface cuts a small chip from the workpiece through a shear deformation.
