## The Difference of Concentric Reducer and Eccentric Reducer
The eccentric reducer pipe is conducive to fluid flow, and changing the diameter has less interference with the fluid flow pattern. Therefore, concentric and eccentric reducer pipes are used in liquid pipes containing gas and vertical flow. Eccentric reducer pipe fitting is a kind of pipe fitting suitable for different pipe diameters.

Thick-Wall Plastic Pipe Fittings for Water. Connect these fittings to thick-wall plastic pipe— they have thicker, stronger walls than standard-wall fittings, so they can handle heavy duty industrial plumbing and water supply applications, such as water processing, waste water treatment, and irrigation. They can withstand pressures up to 900 psi.

## Monel Eccentric Reducers | Fastest Delivery | Instinox
They are used where the diameter of the pipe on the upstream side of the fitting (i.e. where flow is coming from) is larger than the downstream side. Unlike a eccentric reducer, which resembles a cone, eccentric reducers have an edge that is parallel to the connecting pipe. This parallel edge results in the two pipes having offset center lines.
