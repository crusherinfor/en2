Over time, copper in the crushed stone is leached into the solution to become precious liquid, which is collected and pumped to the solvent extraction equipment for further purification. The heap leaching process is widely used in the leaching of low copper surface ore and waste ore.

## Can copper extracted by hydrometallurgy?145
The commonest ore used in the extraction of copper is Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) also known as Copper Pyrites and other such sulphides. The percentage of copper in the actual ore is too low for direct extraction of copper to be viable.  More importantly, most of gold and much silver, large tons of copper and zinc are produced by the

Extraction of copper from copper pyrites involves the following steps. 1. Crushing and concentration. The ore is crushed and then concentrated by froth-floatation process. 2. Roasting. The concentrated ore is heated strongly in the reverberatory furnace, in excess of air. During roasting, i) Moisture is removed.

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

Extraction of Gold using the Borax Process. The borax process is also an environmentally-friendly method of extracting gold. Here the gold-bearing rock material is placed in a melting crucible and then borax (sodium borate) is added. The borax sinks the melting point of the ore mixture and makes the molten mass more fluid.

Copper ore beneficiation methods. Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm.
