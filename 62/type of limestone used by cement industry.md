Limestone Has Dependability. Limestone is one of the most durable options out of all building materials. It's strong and dense, and contains few pores. Less pores make it harder for the stone to break, and allow it to withstand abrasion and freeze-thaw. It's also weather resistant, making it the perfect option no matter the climate you're in.
