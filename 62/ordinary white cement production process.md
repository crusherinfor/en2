## What is Portland cement process of Manufacturing,Dry and Wet
The equipment used in the dry process in comparatively smaller. This process is economical than the wet process. The total consumption of coal in the dry process is only about 100 kg, as compared to the requirement of about 350 kg, for producing a tonne of cement in the wet process. Types of cement. Ordinary Portland cement; Repaid hardening cement

## Cement Manufacturing Process - Civil Engineering
Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.
