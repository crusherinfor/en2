Refractory materials are used in furnaces, kilns, incinerators, and reactors. They are also used to make crucibles and molds for casting glass and metals and for surfacing flame deflector systems for rocket launch structures. Today, the iron- and steel industry uses approximately 70% of all refractories produced.

Approximately 7500 t of spent refractories are landfilled annually in Missouri. Research was initiated to reduce the amount landfilled by studying the types and quantities of spent refractories generated, the conditions of the wastes, and technologies for recycling and reusing spent refractories. This paper reviews the characterization results from three major spent refractory waste streams in.

Residential waste management in the Netherlands, including trash collection and recycling, is administered at the municipal ('gemeente') level. Each household is charged an annual 'afvalbelasting' (garbage tax) to help defray the cost. Municipal websites in the Netherlands publish a calendar of trash collection days for the current year.
