The three main stages of Lead Acid Battery Recycling are • Battery Treatment • Smelting and • Refining 3. 1. BATTERY TREATMENT Batteries are typically unloaded by hand from trailers, conveyors, or from pallets. The batteries are then prepared for smelting by draining the acid and separating the plates, rubber, plastic containers, and sludge.
