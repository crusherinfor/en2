## Crushed Sand - An ERA Universal Group Company
A new trend in crushed sand production. There are two scenarios for a new approach to crushed sand production. One includes choosing the best available geological resources and then trying to copy "mother nature" by putting extreme effort into shaping of the aggregates and the design of grading curves. Another approach involves finding ways

## Study on the Gradation of Crushed Sand by Using a Novel Digital Image 
It is a trend to replace the increasing shortage of natural sand with crushed sand for the development of building materials. To meet the construction requirements, it is necessary to measure the shape and gradation of crushed sand that is difficult to control. To solve this problem, a novel digital image processing methodology is proposed in this paper. Through the setting of camera

Typical sizes are 3/8 minus, 1/4 minus and track fines. True decomposed granite materials have irregular semi round quartz "gravel" aggregates in the 3/8" minus mix. Crushed Stone Fines are almost always are similar to decomposed granite but instead of a high level of quartz (sand like material ) aggregates and fines, they have semi flat stone.
