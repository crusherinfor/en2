## Milling Machine: Definition, Parts, Types, Operations (With PDF)
Milling Machine Definition. The milling machine is defined as perhaps most widely used in manufacturing industries after the lathe machine.. However, In the case of lathe machine tools, the tools used there single-point cutting tools but In the case of this machine, the tool used is multi-point cutting tools.. The milling is a process of metal-removing by feeding the workpiece passes through

Milling machine - aligning vices. In all cases of aligning a vice, what is aligned is always the fixed jaw. When this is aligned it stays aligned whereas the moving jaw can change depending on the workpiece. All of this assumes that the bottom of the space in the vice is parallel to the bottom of the base of the vice.
