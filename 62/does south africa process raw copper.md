## Large quantities of #1 flashingstiefel-test
Scrap yards pay on copper content so here in Aust' scrap yards pay $6.00 kg for scrap copper and pay $2.00 kg for mid grade insulated wire, simply because by weight it contains 32% copper. So there's no added value by stripping wire, strip 300 kg of insulated wire and you end up with $600 of copper, sell 300 kg of insulated wire you get $600.
