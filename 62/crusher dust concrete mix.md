Description. Crusher Dust is a fine powder like material that can be used as a compactable & screedable base under pavers and slabs. Crusher dust is an economical and sturdy material for pathways and driveways because it compacts to a hard and stable surface. Crusher dust may also be referred to as blue metal dust, cracker dust, and quarry sand.

The machine has a screen that traps the larger material (that is, the crushed stone). The smaller material or "screenings" falls through the screen. Depending on the size of the holes in the screen used, it can be so fine in texture that it is basically a powder. This is what you are buying as "stone dust." But it may go by other names, such as:

Answer (1 of 6): Stone dust - if you are talking about the finer particles than 150 micron - it is not recommended to use in concrete. Almost everywhere, concrete is done using crush stone sand. Cement is normally passing through 90 micron. Dust have particles finer than 90 micron. Some have

For M20 grade, 25% is the optimum percentage of stone dust mix with the concrete. 30% of stone dust requires relative high cement content. If 50% replacement of sand 450 kg per meter cube cement needed to achieve the target means strength for M25 grade. Also, the increase in water-cement ratio didn't yield a positive result. AUTHOR

## Using Crusher Dust in Your Construction Project
By nature of the product, crusher dust is easy to work with, spread, and level out. As the material settles, the dust and smaller pieces fill the gaps between larger pieces of stone, creating a smooth and compact surface. The material is tightly packed, which means there is no shifting, no moving, and no potholes developing over time.
