Using a gold wash plant, exposed gold-bearing gravels are mined using a bulldozer that pushes and stockpiles the gravel near a wash plant.The stockpiled gold-bearing gravel is then fed into the wash plant by a front-end loader or large backhoe. This practice promotes equipment efficiency by allowing the bulldozer to continue mining while the loader or backhoe feeds the wash plant at a steady rate.
