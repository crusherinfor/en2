Coal was also used for manufacturing iron, heating buildings, driving locomotives, etc. Between 1769 and 1800, British production of coal doubled - and that was only the beginning of its exponential growth: 12 million Mt in 1800, 25 million in 1830, 50 million in 1850, 100 million in 1870 and, at its peak, nearly 300 million in 1913.

In this essay I will explore in more details the great importance that one of these five simple words, "the coal", had for the British Industrial Revolution. In his "The History of the coal industry" Roy Church writes that "It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of coal to the British economy between 1830 and 1913"1 .

## United Kingdom and coal - Global Energy Monitor
In 1977 over 120 million tonnes of coal was produced in Great Britain, with over 107 million tonnes of that from underground mines. By 2006 underground mines produced just over 9.4 million tonnes. While there was growth in the output of coal from open cut mines during much of the same period, this sector of the industry is now also in decline. [2]

## Why did coal mining industry in Britain collapse? - Quora
The Coal mining industry had been in decline for most of the twentieth century. More mines were closed by Wilsons labour government than by Thatcher. The problem was that most of the UK coal by that time was expensive to mine and costs were high. The industry was being propped up by tax payers subsidies.

By the early 20th century, in terms of size of workforce, coal had become the single biggest industry in Britain. That workforce expanded from 109,000 in 1830 to 1,095,000 in 1913. "At this time, mining productivity in south Wales was something like 300 tonnes of coal per person, per year," says Curtis. "That's equivalent to one miner

The use of coal can be traced back to around A.D. 50 from cinders in Roman ruins in Britain. There is also evidence to suggest that the Greeks used coal as a fuel in the 4th century. However, extensive mining of coal in Britain only started in the 13th century. To find out how coal was mined in the 18th century, try this web page.

Unlike every other country, Britain had more coalminers than agricultural workers and it had them early. By 1800, coal was supplying virtually all our thermal energy and not only that, British coal was by far the cheapest, three times cheaper than American. If energy costs were low, other costs were high.
