## Quality control vs quality assurance (with examples)
Quality control is typically reactive, while quality assurance is proactive. Quality control involves finding the defects in a process, system or output. Based on the results of a quality control test, a quality assurance review should take place. The quality control results should result in modifications and actions to fix the issue.
