## Coal Types, Formation and Methods of Mining
Conventional mining is the oldest method and accounts for only about 12% of underground coal output. In conventional mining, the coal seam is cut, drilled, blasted and then loaded into cars. Continuous mining is the most prevalent form of underground mining, accounting for 56% of total underground production.
