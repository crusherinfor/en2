Clay particles are fine-grained and nearly 1/1000 times finer than a standard sand particle of 1mm size. Water carries claystone particles 100 times farther than the sand particles when it flows. Moreover, the sedimentation of claystone particles requires a relatively calm milieu at the water basins in the river and sea.

What is Limestone: Limestone is primarily composed of calcium carbonate but many contain small amounts of clay, silt and dolomite. Dolomitic limestones come from natural deposits which contain both calcium and magnesium carbonates. The magnesium content of limestone is especially important where soils are deficient in this essential plant nutrient.
