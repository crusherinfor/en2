## Stop Using Limestone Screenings / Crusher Dust / Stone Dust for Pavers 
When comparing stone dust vs sand, this sand is definitely an acceptable material to use under pavers. It provides drainage, wont eat away at the pavers, and it compacts well. With the compaction of the pavers, the sand will work its way into the joints of the pavers from below creating that interlock that is required in an interlocking system.

##  An Experimental Study on Partial Replacement of Sand with  - IJSTE
River sand is costly due to transportation, large scale depletion of resources and enforcement regulations. Quarry dust can be used as an alternative to the river sand. Cost analysis shows that there is 40% savings if quarry dust is used instead of sand. Illangoan.R1 [2000] has done a study on100% replacement of sand by quarry dust in concrete
