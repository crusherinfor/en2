## Cement Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The cement production process is one of the most energy-consuming processes and has a strong environmental impact. The main impact on the energy consumption of cement production is the burning process of cement clinker in a rotary kiln, and the energy costs associated with burning cement clinker constitute 50-75% of cement production costs.

## process of limestone for cement production
Cement Production Process Clinker and cement production is an intensive process in terms of natural raw material and energy input. Limestone (primary source of calcium carbonate CaCO 3 ) and clay (primary source of silica SiO 2, alumina Al 2 O 3 and iron oxide Fe 2 O 3 ) are typically mined in company-owned quarries and pre-blended to a target

## Cement production | Climate Technology Centre & Network | Tue  - CTCN
Because it is both global and local, the cement industry faces a unique set of issues, which attract attention from both local and international level. Cement accounts for 83% of total energy use in the production of non-metallic minerals and 94% of CO2 emissions. Energy represents 20% to 40% of the total cost of cement production.
