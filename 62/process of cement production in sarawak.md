## Cement Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The cement production process is one of the most energy-consuming processes and has a strong environmental impact. The main impact on the energy consumption of cement production is the burning process of cement clinker in a rotary kiln, and the energy costs associated with burning cement clinker constitute 50-75% of cement production costs.

## Cement production | Climate Technology Centre & Network | Tue  - CTCN
Because it is both global and local, the cement industry faces a unique set of issues, which attract attention from both local and international level. Cement accounts for 83% of total energy use in the production of non-metallic minerals and 94% of CO2 emissions. Energy represents 20% to 40% of the total cost of cement production.
