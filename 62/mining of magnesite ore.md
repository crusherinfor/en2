## magnesium processing | Techniques & Methods | Britannica
magnesium processing, preparation of magnesium ore for use in various products. Magnesium (Mg) is a silvery white metal that is similar in appearance to aluminum but weighs one-third less. With a density of only 1.738 grams per cubic centimetre, it is the lightest structural metal known. It has a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystalline structure, so that, like most metals of this structure

## Where is magnesite most commonly found?f
What rock is magnesite found in? Magnesite is a magnesium carbonate mineral (MgCO 3). Unlike related carbonates calcite (CaCO 3) and dolomite (CaMg(CO 3) 2), it is not a major rock-forming mineral. It most commonly occurs in metamorphosed igneous rocks which are rich in magnesium. These are ultramafic rocks like dunite, pyroxenite and peridotite.
