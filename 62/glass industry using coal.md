## Applications Of Dyes And Pigments In Glass Industry
For example, in the 17th century, in the 'black bottle glasses', the color dark brown or green was found due to the present of iron impurities. These impurities came in these glasses from two sources. One, and was used to make these glasses and second, sulphur from the smoke of the burning coal was used for melting these glasses.

Coal was readily available and gettable from shallow workings and drift mines; you didn't have to wait for it to grow and it produced a greater amount of heat given an effective fire grate design. One can assume that much was in place by the mid-17th century in terms of coal-fuelled technology and that its use in glasshouses was common.

The modern Indian glass industry is around 100 years old.

Adopting coal as the main source of fuel created numerous problems for glass production. Burning coal produced short flames which shifted the location of the hearth from the far ends of the furnace to the center.

## Production of glass from coal fly ash - ScienceDirect
The coal fly ash from a Chinese thermal power plant was vitrified after the addition of ∼10 wt% Na 2 O. The glass products have suitable viscosity at 1200. °C and displayed a good chemical durability.. The heavy metals of Pb, Zn, Cr and Mn were successfully immobilized into the glass as determined by the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure method.

## The recycling of the coal fly ash in glass production - PubMed
Recycling of coal fly ash by using vitrification technique resulted to a glass material that had good mechanical, physical and chemical properties. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) results showed that the heavy metals of Pb, Cr, Zn and Mn were successfully immobilized into the glass. It can be said that glass sample obtained by
