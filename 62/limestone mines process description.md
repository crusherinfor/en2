Limestone is a common non-metallic mineral, which is also a trading name as a raw material mineral. Limestone is widely used because of its wide distribution and easy access in nature. There are several types of rock crusher machine can process limestones, such as fixed jaw crusher, impact rock crusher machine, hammer crusher machine, and hydraulic cone crusher machine.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

Several companies reclaim residual limestone 'fines' from slime dams. Quicklime Limestone is converted to quicklime through calcining in rotary or vertical kilns. In the lime process, for every ton of saleable quicklime produced, about 2 tons of 'pure' limestone or up to 6 tons of impure limestone is consumed.

Mining recovery is assumed to be high with values ranging from 95% - 100%. Dilution is projected to be minimal since the nature of the deposit is inherently homogeneous and the mining process is well-established and practiced in quarries of the same or related industry such as cement. All oversize will be recovered and will undergo comminution.

Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.

## What is the limestone's mining process? - Quora
Answer: Limestone deposits are found throughout the world. They are "mined" in a process known as "quarrying." This process varies depending on the use of the product. If it is to be made into cement, it is needed in small pieces so that it can be ground and calcined. In this case, the rock has h

## Deforestation, overgrazing, construction, mining, and poor agricultural 
Deforestation, overgrazing, construction, mining, and poor agricultural practices are some of the man-made factors that lead to erosion. These practices mostly lead to loosening of the soil making it easier for the agents to wash it away. Climate Change, Higher rainfalls lead to more erosion especially in areas with no vegetation cover.

Limestone is a sedimentary rock, although it has a hardness of 3-4 Mohs and a density of 2.5 to 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter. The rock is primarily composed of calcite or calcium carbonate, with most of these rocks being around 95% calcium carbonate. Being so high in calcium makes limestone rock polish and smooth better.

## Limestone: The Calcium Carbonate Chemical Sedimentary Rock - Geology
Limestone, as used by the minerals industry, is any rock composed mostly of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). Although limestone is common in many parts of the United States, it is critically absent from some. Limestone is used to produce Portland cement, as aggregate in concrete and asphalt, and in an enormous array of other products, making it a

## Limestone Treatment of Acid Mine Drainage
The choice of a limestone should be based on the chemical composition, cost, and a laboratory test between the actual limestone and acid mine drainage. For pulverized limestone systems, the smaller the limestone particle size, the faster the reaction and the greater the utilization of the limestone. An excess of 1.4 to three times the
