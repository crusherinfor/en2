The same reasons that led this water to be so clear are the reasons certain quarries are well suited for use as reservoirs. Structural stone is waterproof. "Quarry" could be used as a catchall term for any sort of mine. Quarries for building stone are the ones to use. The Bellwood quarry depicted above was for granite.

Limestone. Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime. It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate ( CaCO3 ). Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium.
