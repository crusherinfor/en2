## Solubility of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate by solid titration
DCPD was the only identified phase at equilibrium at pH 3.60 and 4.50, but HAp was formed after seeding with 1 mg HAp at DCPD equilibrium at pH 4.47, 3.60 and 3.30. It is concluded that the titration curve observed for DCPD corresponds to the solubility isotherm for the phase, but that this represents a metastable equilibrium.
