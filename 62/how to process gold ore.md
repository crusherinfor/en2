## How to Identify Gold Ore?
The first step in the recovery of gold from gold ore is to determine its density. It is important to know the density of the ore so that the process can be most effective. Afterward, the gold will be released from the ore by cyanidation. A process called roasting can also be used. It reduces the cost of the recovery process.

Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity - known as doré - typically containing between 60-90% gold. During its life, a number of factors - such as the price of gold or input costs - will affect which areas of an ore body are deemed profitable (economic) to mine.

## Gold processing 101 - Mining Magazine
Metallurgical processing of metalliferous ores in general and gold ores in particular, consists essentially of three stages, often colloquially referred to as: Bashing (crushing); Mashing (grinding); and. Hashing (extraction/recovery) In the context of flowsheet selection, the bashing and mashing stages are relatively straightforward.

Gold smelting flux helps us to take advantage of this fact in the smelting process. Flux is able to react only with the impure metals, thereby causing them to form nitrates which can separate out neatly. Again, smelting flux makes metallic oxides easy to eliminate, thereby removing another major source of impurity.

Gold mining continued for decades, changing hands numerous times until it was closed in 1991. Ore values were generally low, but new extraction methods allowed the mine to remain active, though intermittently, for over a century. This is one of the few active mining operations of any significance that operated in this part of the country.
