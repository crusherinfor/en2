## India's coal industry in flux as government sets ambitious coal 
From 2005 to 2012, India's coal production grew by only 4.7% per year to about 600 million metric tons while the country's coal-fired electric power capacity grew by a much faster rate (about 9.4% per year), reaching 150 gigawatts. To help resolve the shortfall in coal supply and to support expanded coal-fired generation, India has set a coal

## Coal Production Grows in India | Coal Age
The ash of Indian coal is of inherent nature and has a high presence of near gravity material (NGM). This makes washing Indian coal rather difficult. Conclusion. India's mining sector has grown at a slower rate compared to GDP, resulting in a decrease in the contribution of mining sector to India's GDP from 1.3% in 2002 to just 1% in 2012.
