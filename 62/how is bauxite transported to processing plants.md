The Bayer Process The Bayer Process, which is used by about 80 active plants worldwide, is the primary method of producing aluminum from bauxite. Bauxite ore is dissolved in sodium hydroxide, or lye, at a high temperature and pressure. Then, the alumina and bauxite ores are separated by washing out the waste (red muds or sands) from the alumina.
