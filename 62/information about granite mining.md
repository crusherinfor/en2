How Granite is Mined and Imported. Granite is found close to the surface, meaning it can be cut from shallow quarries. Small holes are drilled to get the shape of the desired block size (making it easier to transport). Explosives are placed into these holes to carefully create a blast that's just strong enough to separate the granite from the
