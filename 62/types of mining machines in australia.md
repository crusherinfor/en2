Automated mining involves the removal of human labor from the mining process. The mining industry is in the transition towards automation.It can still require a large amount of human capital, particularly in the developing world where labor costs are low so there is less incentive for increasing efficiency. There are two types of automated mining- process and software automation, and the

There are five basic types of surface mining, including open-pit mining, strip mining, dredging, mountaintop removal, and high wall mining. All of these methods remove the waste material or the overburden, which is above the desired resource. Often, surface mining is preferred over underground mining, or subsurface mining, for numerous reasons.
