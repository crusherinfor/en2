Gold deposits along the general gold path can be small or large, depending upon the size of the gold trap. The most important type of gold trap in river mining is called the pay-streak. Pay-streaks always form along the gold path where the rivers flow slows down on a large scale during a major flood storm.

When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.
