In open pit mining of solid rock the material is mostly broken loose from the rock formation by means of preliminary blasting operations. The primary crushing unit is located close to the mining face, for the purpose of reducing the material size so that it can be conveyed rather than hauled by trucks.

## In-Pit Crushing - World of Mining Professionals
These operations first conceived the idea of crushing material in the pit before removing it to the processing plant or stockpiles using a system of conveyors, and continuous mining systems are still prevalent in these operations today. When the first commercial-scale systems were introduced in the 1970s/80s, there were a few unsuccessful projects.

Blasting is an essential part of it, and it accounts for 15-20% of the total cost of open pit mining. And the quality of blasting directly affects the efficiency of equipment such as mining, transportation, and coarse crushing and the total cost of the mine.
