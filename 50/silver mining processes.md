The first stage of mining silver involves the crushing the silver ore to about 1-1.5in diameter so as to make the ore porous for the extraction process. Once the ore is crushed it is then mixed with lime (about 3-5 lb. per ton) to create a conducive alkaline conditions for the extractions. The ore is then stacked onto impermeable pads made of

## About Silver Mining & Silver In India
Silver Mining. This precious metal is mined as a mixture in ores along with other metals such as copper, gold, lead, zinc, sulphur, antimony, arsenic or chlorine. Silver has been mined since the 4 th millennium BC since its use in the making of coins had made it a lucrative business. In fact, silver mines have attracted as much crowd rush as

## Silver: A native element, mineral, alloy, and byproduct - Geology
Most of the silver produced today is a byproduct of mining copper, lead, and zinc. The silver occurs within the ores of these metals in one of two ways: 1) substituting for one of the metal ions within the ore mineral's atomic structure; or, 2) occurring as an inclusion of native silver or a silver mineral within the ore mineral.
