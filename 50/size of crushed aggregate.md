With most particles going through a 3/8-inch sieve, fine aggregates typically consist of natural sand or crushed stone. All particles larger than 0.19 inches are coarse aggregates but usually vary between 3/8 and 1.5 inches in diameter. Gravels make up much of the remaining coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone.
