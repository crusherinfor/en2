## The types of drives used by electric cylinder
A linear actuator is a means for converting rotational motion into push or pull linear motion, which can be used for lifting, dropping, sliding, or tilting of machines or materials. They provide safe and clean motion control that is efficient and maintenance free. Electric linear actuators use a DC or AC motor with a series of gears and a lead.

## How do linear motors work? A simple introduction to maglev
Dec 17, 2021Linear motors are electric induction motors that produce motion in a straight line rather than rotational motion. In a traditional electric motor, the rotor (rotating part) spins inside the stator (static part); in a linear motor, the stator is unwrapped and laid out flat and the "rotor" moves past it in a straight line.

## Linear motor - Types and construction - IntelLiDrives
In a linear motor, the rotor rolled out to become a magnet track. The rotary stator became linear motor forcer coil assembly. It is typical, in linear applications, for magnet track to be stationary and to have a moving forcer assembly, due to their relative sizes and masses. In short stroke applications, their positions can be reversed.

A Linear Induction Motor (LIM) is an advanced version of rotary induction motor which gives a linear translational motion instead of rotational motion. The stator is cut axially and spread out flat. In this type of motor, the stator and rotor are called primary and secondary, respectively. The secondary of the linear induction motor consists of a flat aluminium conductor with a ferromagnetic core.

A linear actuator is a piece of mechanical equipment commonly used on industrial scale in brakes, stamping presses, and car jacks. It acts by using power to generate straight-line motion. It is achieved by employing a lead-screw that creates up and down movement by turning to the left or to the right.

## What is a linear motor? | Tecnotion
The linear motor primary part is connected to the power supply to produce a magnet field. By changing the current phase in the coils, the polarity of each coil is changed. The attractive and repelling forces between the coils in the primary part and the magnets in the secondary part cause the primary to move and generate a linear force.
