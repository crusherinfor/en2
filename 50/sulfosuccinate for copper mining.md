## Homogeneous Chemical Precipitation Route to ZnO Nanosphericals
A versatile route has been explored for the synthesis of nanorods of transition metal (Cu, Ni, Mn, Zn, Co and Fe) oxalates using reverse micelles. Transmission electron microscopy shows that the as-prepared nanorods of nickel and copper oxalates have diameter of 250nm and 130nm while the length is of the order of 2.5μm and 480nm, respectively.

Copper is also made into alloys with other metals. Combined with zinc, it makes brass. Mixed with tin and zinc, it creates bronze. Copper is also a necessity for human health; we need a daily supply of this mineral. People get their dietary copper through things like seafood and other meats, whole grains, nuts, raisins, and even chocolate.
