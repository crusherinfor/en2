Coal fired power plants also known as coal fired power stations are facilities that burn coal to make steam in order to generate electricity. These stations, seen in Figure 1, provide ~40% of the world's electricity. [2] Countries such as South Africa use coal for 94% of their electricity and China and India use coal for 70-75% of their

## Coal fired Plants: Pros and Cons - Bright Hub Engineering
Affordability. Energy produced from coal fired plants is cheaper and more affordable than other energy sources. Since coal is abundant, it is definitely cheap to produce power using this fuel. Moreover, it is not expensive to extract and mine from coal deposits. Consequently, its price remains low compared to other fuel and energy sources.

## What Grade Of Coal Is Used In Coal Fired Plants
The two coal types most commonly used in U.S. coal-fired power plants are bituminous and subbituminous coal. Generating units that burn bituminous coal were generally older and smaller, leading to more of them retiring than units fueled by subbituminous coal, particularly from 2011 to 2015.

## In India, what type of coal is used for thermal electricity?
Answer: Lignite coal Used almost exclusively for electric power generation lignite is a young type of coal. Lignite is brownish black, has a high moisture content (up to 45 %), and a high suphur content. Lignite is more like soil than a rock and tends to disintegrate when exposed to the weather.

## What Grade Of Coal Is Used In Coal Fired Plant
What Is Coal Used For Usgs. Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam, which drives a turbine, which produces electricity.
