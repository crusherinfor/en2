## Gemstone Size: Stone Density and Buyer's Tips | Blue Nile
In general, larger gemstones are more valuable than smaller gemstones. You'll often pay less by buying more, smaller gems that add up to a certain weight than a single gemstone of the same weight. For example, four ½-carat emeralds or rubies will cost less than a single, two-carat emerald or ruby. Gemstone dimensions paint a more accurate

## Gemstone Density: The Definitive Guide at AJS Gems
The density is expressed as a number which indicates how much heavier the gemstone is compared to an equal volume of water. Most gemstone varieties are 2 to 4 times denser than a equal volume of water. But the range is quite wide -- from 8 for cinnabar to 1 for amber. Diamond, at 3.50 to 3.53, falls approximately in the middle.

First off, locate the type of stone you are using on the chart. Next multiply the cubic feet you obtained from using step one to the number in the minimum lbs/ft3 column. That number is approximately the minimum weight of the stone. You then do the same in the maximum lbs/ft3 column to obtain the maximum weight of the stone.
