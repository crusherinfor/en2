## Does concrete have high embodied energy?
What is embodied energy of concrete? The total energy intensity for concrete is calculated to be 11.01 MJ/€. Using the same assumptions as above this is converted to relevant units. The resultant total embodied energy, EE of concrete is calculated to be 0.298 MJ/kg. Consequently, the indirect EE of concrete is found to be 0.097 MJ/kg.

the relative value of the embodied en- ergy and operating energy should be more fully investigated for historic structures.6 the ratio between total embodied energy and annual operating energy varies between 5:1 and 30:1. 7 historic buildings are more likely to be at the higher end of this ratio because of their use of durable, bulky materials .

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
Crushed stone: The term "crushed stone" usually refers to stone that has a mixture of stone dust in it. This type of stone is best used for a base when heavy compaction is needed. As a result, it is typically used for the base of concrete and paving projects, foundations of structures, and driveway bases.
