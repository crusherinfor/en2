The beauty of the Blast Furnace is that it only needs half the normal coal that is required for making bars, but you can still make a lot of bars per hour. Most of the smelting recipes are either yellow or green, so listing the exact number of ores required is not possible for this mining leveling guide TBC. However, here is an approximate number.

Cupellation is a process that purifies ores by separating gold and silver from base metals and other impurities. The process makes use of a cupel - a high temperature resistant flat bowl. The ore is placed in this cupel which is put in a special furnace. Hot air is then passed through it to remove the impurities.
