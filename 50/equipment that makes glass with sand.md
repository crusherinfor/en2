Step 2: Refining. Although crude glass can be produced through heating together sand, ashes, quicklime (calcium oxide), soda (sodium oxide), and silica (silicon dioxide), this form of glass is extremely impure. Most modern glass is made from various refined ingredients mixed to produce molten glass with a much more homogenous composition.
