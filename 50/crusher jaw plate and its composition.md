## crusher jaw plate and its composition
Nov 08, 2019· The composition of a jaw crusher is characterized by its two jaw plates, one fixed and the other moving, both oriented to create a V-shaped chamber through which materials fall and become repeatedly crushed. These crusher jaw plates are most often corrugated in appearance but can also be smooth.

Rose and English [9] determined the capacity of a jaw crusher by considering the time taken and the distance travelled by the particles between the two plates after being subjected to repeat crushing forces between the jaws. Therefore, dry particles wedged between level A and level B (Figure 4.4) would leave the crusher at the next reverse movement of the jaw.
