1. Regenerating Citric Acid. To purify citric acid, lime is essentially used. Initially, the citric acid solution is filtered well to abstract its properties, removing suspended solids from it. To this filtered solution, hydrated lime is added for further purification. As a result, calcium citrate precipitates from the solution and is removed.

For water treatment purposes, high-calcium or calcium lime only is used. Hydrated lime, Ca(OH) 2, is a dry powder and is produced by adding sufficient water to quicklime to combine chemically with its calcium oxide content to produce calcium hydroxide: CaO + H 2 O = Ca(OH) 2. In other words, hydrated lime is the product obtained when from 22 to.

Summary. Lime is used to increase soil pH to optimal levels (6.0-6.8) for plant growth. Lime recommendations are given when soil pH values drop below critical thresholds that cause expected yield reduction. Critical thresholds vary by crop tolerance such that lime is recommended for legumes at pH<6.0 and grasses at pH<5.3.

##  Properly Applying Hydrated - University of Kentucky
Please note, hydrated lime is caustic (able to burn organic tissue by chemical action), therefore, rinse foliage before it dries (Fig. 6) and avoid skin contact. Results may be erratic. Hydrated lime only supplies calcium (Ca) but not magnesium (Mg) though one should not rely on limestone amendments to provide Ca and Mg nutritional requirements.

## Hydrated Lime Production from Limestone - Entrepreneur India
Description: The term "hydrated lime" is widely used to describe a powdered calcium hydroxide product made by reacting quicklime with a controlled excess of water. The product is essentially dry and generally contains less than 1% of un-reacted water. The process is called "hydration" and should be differentiated from "slaking
