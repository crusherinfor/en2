## sandblasting with crushed glass | SailNet Community
Joined Jan 2, 2007. 7,811 Posts. #8 · Apr 28, 2013. I refused to use a contractor to blast my hull because he wanted to use crushed glass (aka silica, aka sand) Sand is much too abrasive, and has too much mass. I found another contractor that used baking soda as a blast media, and was/am VERY happy with the results.
