## Replacing natural sand by crushed rock in concrete using nonlinear 
The availability of sand is also reducing and in many countries, authorities have put restrictions on the use of natural sand. Crushed rock and waste aggregate tend to have less rounded edges and corners resulting in poorer flow of fresh mortar. A proper rheology is imperative for grouts and self-compacting concretes, and this limits the amount

## sandblasting with crushed glass | SailNet Community
Joined Jan 2, 2007. 7,811 Posts. #8 Â· Apr 28, 2013. I refused to use a contractor to blast my hull because he wanted to use crushed glass (aka silica, aka sand) Sand is much too abrasive, and has too much mass. I found another contractor that used baking soda as a blast media, and was/am VERY happy with the results.
