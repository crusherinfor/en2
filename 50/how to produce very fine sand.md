Mixing biochar with manure - "the dry method". It's quite simple - just mix your charcoal or coal with some moist animal manure and let it "mature" for at least 2-3 weeks. We used 1 part coal dust to 3 parts horse manure, because that's what was available. You can also use chicken, pig, or cow manure.
