## Difference Between Milling Machines & CNC Router | CAMaster
Milling machines can cut as close as 1,000th of an inch when cutting metal. CNC routers cut at a higher speed than milling machines. Cutting speeds for milling machines are much slower than CNC routers. Milling machines often produce fewer than 1,000 RPMs, while those of CNC routers are more often up to 18,000 RPMs and higher.
