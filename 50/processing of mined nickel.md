This makes limonite mining cheaper and limonite mining is complete before saprolite. Nickel ore is mined using the selective open pit mining method with backhoe equipment for excavation and trucks for transportation. No drilling or blasting is required in nickel ore mining or any complicated processing, other than drying and screening ore.

The making of nickel is a process which involves a number of steps: 1. Mining. Nickel mined from lateritic ore is mined from various depths beneath the surface using large earth-moving equipment. The other nickel containing type of ore, sulfidic ore, is usually found in combination with copper ore and is mined underground.

The Gap Nickel Mine was discovered in 1732, and was worked to some extent for copper, but was abandoned due to the small quantities present in the ore. In the early 1850's, it was discovered that the large ore vein contained a considerable quantity of nickel.

## Nickel | Geoscience Australia
The project is a brownfields extension 1-1.2 km north-northwest of the historical Carr Boyd Nickel Mine, which produced 202.1 kt of ore at an average grade of 1.43% Ni and 0.46% Cu, producing a 9.7% Ni concentrate.  Nova-Bollinger has a predicted mine life of approximately 6.5 years assuming a mining and processing rate of 1.5 Mtpa 69.
