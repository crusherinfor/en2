## Sponge Iron Production By Direct Reduction Of Iron Oxide
This book provides a fascinating study of the very important emerging field of direct reduction in which iron ore is 'directly reduced' in the solid-state, using either natural gas or non-coking coal, to produce a highly metallised material, referred to as sponge iron (or direct reduced iron). This intermediate product is subsequently

## JSW - Corex-Green Technology to produce hot metal
Corex is a smelting-reduction process developed by VAI, for cost-efficient and environmentally friendly production of hot metal from iron ore and low grade coal. The process differs from the conventional blast furnace route in that low grade coal can be directly used for ore reduction and melting work, eliminating the need for coke making units.

Overview. India is world's largest producer of sponge iron produced through direct reduction of iron-ore / iron pellet in the solid state. Since the higher grade domestic lumpy ore will be exhausted in the next 10 years and value additions to the Iron Ore Fines by various processes such as Pelletisation is the need of present scenario which will be economically beneficial in the long run.
