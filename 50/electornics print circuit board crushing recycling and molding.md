The Effect Of Mechanical226;€Physical Pretreatment On. A key motivation for recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment (weee) is the content of many types of valuable materials, as in other studies (yamane et al., 2011; veit et al., 2005; kasper et al., 2011). most weee includes printed circuit boards (pcbs) that are normally separated by handpicking or sensorbased sorting.

3.1 Recovery of copper metal from edge trim of printed circuit boards Printed circuit board edge trim has high copper content ranging from 25% to 60%, as well as precious metal content (> 3 ppm). The process for recovery of copper and precious metals from printed circuit board edge trim is similar to that from waste printed circuit boards.

## Waste Scrap Electronic Pcb Crushing Recycling Machine Pcb Mother Board 
The waste circuit board recycling equipment adopts double-shaft shredding type for primary crushing, and blade crushing type for secondary and tertiary crushers. The material is crushed into powder by three levels of crushing, and then separated by air separation equipment, electrostatic separation equipment.

## Recycling printed circuit boards - ScienceDirect
Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are the supplier of electronic components and electronic interconnections ( Akcil et al., 2015, Awasthi et al., 2016a ). The key advantage of PCBs lies in its capability to greatly reduce the errors of routing and assembly and to increase the degree of automation and fabrication efficiency.
