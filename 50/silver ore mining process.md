## Excellent Description of the Silver Mining Process
You probably know that silver is a metal that's mined and then somehow refined to form the pure coins and bars we trade as bullion, but would you like to know a little more about that process? We've found an excellent little YouTube excerpt by the Discovery Channel on the process of mining and refining silver.

Back then, American miners knew very little about silver mining, so they borrowed a process of amalgamation from the Germans (called the Freiberg process). However, the German process was too slow for the Comstock mines, so Almarin B. Paul and other American miners replaced copper pans with steam-heated iron pans, which cut the patio process

Finding the metal was only part of the process. After the discovery was made the next step was to bring the ore out of the ground. In the dry Mojave, hard rock miners dug and blasted, sinking shafts and tunnelings into the mountainside. Next, the ore would have to be crushed into a workable size before the metal could be extracted.

Ore processing. Once removed from the mine, silver-containing ore is crushed (commutation) into a fine powder to expose individual grains to chemical processing.As a byproduct of mining of lead and copper, silver ores are often purified by froth flotation.After froth flotation, silver is extracted by a cyanide process, akin to technology used for gold extraction.
