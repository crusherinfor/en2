## Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP): Why It's Important  - Safeopedia
A Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) is a systematic investigation of a present or planned process or operation. It was originally designed to assess chemical plants and the procedure and processes used in them but is now applied more widely. The goal of a HAZOP study is to identify and evluate any problems within a plant or work environment that could pose a risk to the employees or equipment.

The HAZOP study should preferably be carried out as early in the design phase as possible - to have inﬂuence on the design. On the other hand; to carry out a HAZOP we need a rather complete design. As a compromise, the HAZOP is usually carried out as a ﬁnal check when the detailed design has been completed.

HAZOP (Hazard and Operability) study is one of the most widely used hazard identification methods in the world and is utilized across many different industries. Countless potential risks and problems can be identified by using the systematic and structured approach of HAZOP. A successful HAZOP study is only possible if the study is led effectively.

## HAZOP Studies: Advantages and Disadvantages of its Use
The HAZOP method has a built-in brainstorming methodology, which can help to detect problems early. Using the HAZOP method, emergency response processes are split into 5 main stages which help frame the thinking process. These 5 stages are. Setting up emergency command posts. Restricting access within, to and from the facility.
