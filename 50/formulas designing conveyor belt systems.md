## Factors to Consider When Designing Conveyor I
The dimension and type of the conveyor belt determine the driven and driver pulley diameter. The essence of having the right diameter is to ensure that no undue stress is put on the belt in times of operation. The length from the center pulley accounts for the length of the belt, considering the distance parallel to the belt line.
