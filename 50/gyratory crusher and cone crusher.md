## Gyratory Crusher & Cone Crusher Mantle Differences
In the Gyratory all the movement is in the bottom of the crusher mantle. This is due to the angle that the main shaft is on. The greater angle of the cone crusher puts the pivot point below the distributor plate. While the pivot point for the gyratory crusher is at the spider cap. This difference in the pattern of gyration has a purpose.

Cone Crushers; Typically, the initial crushing stage is completed using either gyratory crushers or jaw crushers. It is often the case that there will be only one crusher installed, and this will be referred to as the 'Primary Crusher'. Cone crushers are typically used for 2 nd, 3 rd & 4 th stage crushing steps (although not always).

## Difference between Cone & Gyratory Crusher
A gyratory crusher has a higher angle at the cone apex. This provides a longer residence time along the crushing interface and is supposed to generate a smaller & more consistent product. Metso Minerals have much more, probably much better, information on their website. 28th January 2009, 0:44 #3.

## Cone Crushers - SolidsWiki
A cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones.A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner.

CONE CRUSHER. Cone crushers are similar to gyratory crushers in that they have a mantle that rotates within a bowl, but the chamber is not as steep. They are compression crushers that generally provide reduction ratios of 6-to-1 to 4-to-1. Cone crushers are used in secondary, tertiary and quaternary stages.
