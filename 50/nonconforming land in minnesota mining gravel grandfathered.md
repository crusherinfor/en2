A nonconforming lot is one that, at the time of its establishment, met the minimum lots size requirements for the zone in which it is located but which, because of subsequent changes to the minimum lot size applicable to that zone, is now smaller than that minimum lot size. State law does not regulate nonconforming uses, structures, or lots.

## Dane County Nonconforming Use Gravel Pits - Axley Brynelson, LLP
In 1968, Dane County adopted an ordinance that changed the land use for non-metallic mineral extraction from a permitted use to a conditional use. Owners/operators were allowed to register existing quarries to preserve the legal nonconforming use status. Dane County then verified each site and created a list of nonconforming use gravel pits.

## Self Help Nonconforming (Grandfather) Rights - Municipality of Anchorage
A person who asserts that something exists has the burden of proving that it exists. This is especially true of nonconforming rights. The burden of proof is on the property owner. "The Muni" (specifically Land Use Review) does not grant nonconforming rights. We simply recognize nonconformities that are documented to exist.
