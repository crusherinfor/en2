## Lime/limestone flue gas desulfurization inspection and  - EPA
In the lime/limestone FGD process shown in Figure 2.3-1, flue gas, from which fly ash has been removed in a particulate collection device such as an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) or a fabric filter, is brought into contact with the lime/limestone slurry in the absorber, where SO^ is removed.

## A Day in the Life: What Goes On at a Quarry - MDLPA
The quarrying process is also known as "extraction.". This procedure consists of removing blocks or large pieces of stone from a previously identified geological deposit. The different methods used to quarry or extract the limestone depends on the specific properties of the limestone deposit itself, including density, bedding planes, and depth.
