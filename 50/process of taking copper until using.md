The refining anodes taken out from the refining furnace is changed into electrolytic copper with purity of 99.99% through an electrolysis process: During electrolysis, copper (II) ions leave the impure copper anode and since they are positive, migrating to the negative cathode. From time to time, the pure copper is scraped off the cathode.

## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

## Still copper toxic two years later? - How I Recovered
This is one reason many people feel better taking a lot of vitamin C. Copper tends to oxidize and destroy vitamin C in the body. Meanwhile, vitamin C chelates or removes copper from the body. This requires a dose of vitamin C of at least about 500 mg daily, far higher than the minimum daily requirement of about 60 mg.

Copper can be extracted from non-sulphide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulphuric acid to produce a very dilute copper (II) sulphate solution. Concentration of the copper (II) sulphate solution by solvent extraction.
