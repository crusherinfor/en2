## How is Iron Ore Mined
Most of the iron ore produced in the world is extracted from the earth's crust through opencast mining. This involves removing the overburden by making use of explosives to expose the bedrock containing iron ore. Mining of iron ore can be manual or it can be mechanized depending upon the size of the mine and the reserves of iron ore to be

Aluminum is a raw Resource used to progress your Faction through Weapons and Equipment research. Aluminum can be obtained by mining special nodes which spawn in Salvage Fields when Salvage nodes split after being hammered. Note: You will normally get a larger Aluminum node if it spawns from the first time a Salvage node splits. The amount you can expect to gather per Salvage field is dependent

Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.
