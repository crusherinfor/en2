Jun 2, 2021China Energy is planning new coal mines and developing new coal-fired power plants with a total capacity of 51 GW, not only in China. Two new power stations in Indonesia have just been brought online and the 600 MW Sumsel 1, is under construction. Another major recipient is state-owned power provider China Huaneng with $1.2 billion.

President Xi regularly mentions China's commitment to multilateralism through fighting climate change as a signatory of the Paris Agreement. China, however, is unlikely to divest from coal anytime soon. Despite hefty investment in renewable energy over the past decade, China still mines and burns about half the world's coal.
