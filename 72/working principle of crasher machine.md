This friction causes the plastics to be finely grounded over a period of time till the desired smoothness is acquired. Afterwards, the screen plate is removed from the plastic crusher, yielding the desired product. The plastic crusher machine has a blade with makes this process easy, as noiseless as possible and requires minimal energy.

## The Working Principle Of A Jaw Crusher - Editors Top
The working principle of the jaw crushers is very simple. Powered by a diesel or gas motor, the jaw crusher brakes materials in a crushing chamber. The materials are pushed inside the chamber from the top opening and when crushed they are released through the bottom opening. The crushing power of the jaw crushers depends on the size of the chamber.

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws. The moving jaw moves back and forward against the fixed jaw, and material fed from the top of the machine is compressed

## Working principle of small glass crusher machine - Sunco Machinery
On the center shaft of the small glass crusher machine, there are many hammers.When the glass bottle crusher is working, the motor makes the center shaft rotate in high speed. As a result, the hammers also are rotating in high speed. The glass bottles are crushed into small pieces by the high speed rotating hammers.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
