Limestone is a type of sedimentary rock that is found naturally in the earth's environment. The rock comprises primarily calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) in the form of calcite which is yet again a type of mineral.It also contains other materials like quartz, clay minerals, pyrite, feldspar, and siderite amongst others.
