## 20 Types of Construction Materials | What Is Building Materials List 
1. Artificial construction materials The materials manufactured artificially and used in the different construction activities are known as Artificial construction materials. Examples of Artificial construction materials are bricks, cement, steel, glass, and plastics, etc. 2. Natural construction materials

## Numerical Simulation on Sand Accumulation behind Artificial Reefs and 
An artificial reef has the similar wave-dissipating effect as a detached breakwater; thus, sand deposition occurs in the lee of the constructed structure. For example, on Kimigahama Beach in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, salients were formed after the construction of two artificial reefs owing to the wave-sheltering effect of the reefs.
