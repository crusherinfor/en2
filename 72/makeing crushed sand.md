The intense action created by the tumbling of rock particles thoroughly disintegrates the clay fraction and prepares the material for final sizing. The scrubber discharge is screened at ½- inch to produce a 1½" x ½" roadstone product which is stockpiled. Next, the ½" x 3/8" pea gravel is screened out and stockpiled.
