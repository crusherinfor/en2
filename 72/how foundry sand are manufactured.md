## Sand Casting For Manufacture
Usually sand used to manufacture a mold for the casting process is held together by a mixture of water and clay. A typical mixture by volume could be 89% sand, 4% water, 7% clay. Control of all aspects of the properties of sand is crucial when manufacturing parts by sand casting, therefore a sand laboratory is usually attached to the foundry.

##  Foundry Sand User Guidelines - University of Wisconsin-Madison
Foundry sand consists primarily of silica sand (>80% silcon dioxide), coated with a thin film of burnt carbon and residual binder (Du et al 2002). Loss on ignition in foundry sand has been reported by the American Foundrymen's Association (1991) to be around 5%. Depending on the binder and type of metal being cast, the pH of foundry sand can

Step by step First a pattern must be made from the original design. The bell is drawn as a finished piece, then a profile of the bell is developed. The profile drawing is then transferred to a template which is used as a sweep. Rotating the sweep around setting plaster creates a pattern which can be used as a die to make other pattern copies.

A foundry or metal factory casts metals into shapes by melting them down and pouring the molten liquid into a sand, ceramic or metal mould to form geometrically complex parts. The metal is then allowed to cool and the liquid solidifies. The shaped metal, or casting, can now be used to produce more difficult and uniquely shaped products or parts.

FOUNDRY SAND WASTE. Foundries create metal castings for use in the automotive, art, construction, agriculture, and mining industries. In this process, molten metal is poured into a mold, usually made from sand or ceramics. As castings are created, the sand has to be removed and replaced due to abrasion from the high heat and mechanical stress.
