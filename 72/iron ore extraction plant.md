## Top Challenges Impacting Growth of the Iron Ore Market - SpendEdge
China has faced a significant blow due to such laws as it is the biggest importer of iron ore. Huge Capital Requirements. Iron ore mining requires substantial capital investments due to energy-intensive nature of the extraction process. For instance, the average cost of an iron ore project was around US$236/tonne of capacity in 2014.

There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

At the processing plant, the taconite is crushed into very small pieces by rock crushing machines. The crushers keep crushing the rock until it is the size of a marble. The rock is mixed with water and ground in rotating mills until it is as fine as powder. Separation The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism.

## Iron Ore Processing
In iron ore crushing plant, customers usually choose a complete iron ore production line for higher efficiency. At present, the most popular iron ore production lines consists of two jaw crushers. After crushing, the material will be sent for the magnetic separation, and then into the ball mill for grinding. Iron Ore Grinding: Ball mill is the

## Iron Extraction Process - ROGESA
At the bottom of the furnace the iron ore is chemically reduced. The blast reacts with the coke; carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are formed at temperatures of up to 2000 °C. The carbon monoxide removes the oxygen from the iron ore resulting in pig iron production. Slag is formed from the other ore components and the additions.

The remaining 2% of domestic iron ore was produced for non-steel end uses. Seven open-pit iron ore mines (each with associated concentration and pelletizing plants), and three iron metallic plants—one direct-reduced iron (DRI) plant and two hot-briquetted iron (HBI) plants— operated during the year to supply steelmaking raw materials.
