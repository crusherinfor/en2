## Material Quality of Impact Crushers vs. Jaw Crushers
The jaw is a compaction crusher and squeezes material while crushing. The impact crusher is an explosion crusher that impacts and explodes material. The quality of the finished product does depend on one's perspective of exactly what the target is. If one's target is to produce fines, the impact crusher may be a better choice.

## Crushers - Thompson Tractor
Impact Crushers are best used with softer rock, such as limestone and sandstone, and for recycling processed materials like concrete and asphalt. Impact crushers tend to produce more "fines" than Jaw crushers. Jaw Crushers have two opposing ribbed panels, or jaws, with one jaw moving forward and back to crush raw material against the fixed jaw.

## Cone Crusher vs. Impact Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone. For impact crusher, the high-speed rotating rotor throw stone into impact plates, stones are crushed via impact energy produced rotating rotor.

Dec 20, 2021I would say that in general, yeah, there's definitely some maintenance involved with crushing. Typically we're looking at the wear parts or the actual parts of the crusher that are impacted by the material. So if it's an impact crusher it would be the blow bars. If it's a jaw crusher it's the jaw dies or jaw plates.

## Impact Crusher vs. Jaw crusher, Which One Should I Choose
Jaw crushers are often used in primary crushing applications. Impact crushers are usually used for applications where the stone is softer, has a lower density and less abrasive. The high-speed rotating rotor throws the stone into the impact toggles, and the impact energy generated by the rotor breaks the rock along its natural fracture line.
