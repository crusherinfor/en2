## How to Make Portland Cement Mortar | eHow
Mortar is the cement-like material used to bond bricks, stones and other masonry. Most mortar is a combination of Portland cement, hydrated lime, sand and water. The four main types of mortar are identified by the letters M, N, O and S. Each has a different proportion of the four ingredients, creating mortar of different strengths.

Do not apply over asphalt that has been sealed with tar because the surface becomes to slick for Portland cement to adhere. Best if applied in early spring on dry days. Driving and walking on powder cement is all it needs for compaction. Note: it makes a minor mess and the cement blows very little. Have fun.

This means concrete is a mixture of Portland cement and additional aggregates such as stones, gravel, and sand, creating the large hard masses of concrete slabs. Whereas concrete mixes may have pieces of stone that are visible, the raw materials used to make Portland cement are heat-treated and pulverized down to a powder form.

Simply put, Portland cement is a binding component found in both concrete and mortar. It is, therefore, never used by itself. To make cement, limestone, silica sand, clay, and shells are crushed and combined with other ingredients and heated to roughly 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit. After being heated, the material that is created is known as clinker.
