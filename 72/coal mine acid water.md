When coal mining began in Appalachia and western Maryland at the advent of the Industrial Revolution, there was little regard for the environment (as was the case with many practices back then).  Importantly, this drainage also turns the water acidic (hence the name acid mine drainage), and gives it a bright orange color.

Coal mining. Mining operations can negatively impact water supplies, often with long-lasting effects.

During the 19th and 20th Century, the "bord and pillar" method of underground mining was implemented in a number of mines throughout large areas of Newcastle ( NSW ) and Ipswich (QLD) in Australia. With rapid urban development in recent years, many of the old mines have been abandoned and the mined areas have become densely populated.

Acid mine drainage (AMD) refers to the outflow of acidic water from coal or metal mines, often abandoned ones where ore- or coal mining activities have exposed rocks containing the sulphur-bearing mineral pyrite.
