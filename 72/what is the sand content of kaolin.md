Calcined kaolin or metakaolin appears powdered, white, and non-plastic. This material is made by firing raw kaolin in a rotary calcining kiln with a high enough temperature that it has lost approximately 12% of its crystal water content. You can also make calcined kaolin by bisque firing powdered kaolin in a small bisque vessel with a slow ramp.
