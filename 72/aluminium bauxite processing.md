Aluminium is made from bauxite, or aluminium ore. Bauxite is the basic raw material that is refined into alumina, which in turn is sent to smelters for processing into aluminium. First discovered near Les Beaux in the South of France in 1821, bauxite was initially called "beauxite". In 1886, Charles Martin Hall and Paul HÃ©roult

Bauxite is then converted into aluminum oxide, or alumina, using natural gas at plants located in the southern United States. After alumina is extracted from bauxite ore, further processing called 'smelting' is necessary to convert it into aluminum. In this process, alumina is dissolved in a solution and a strong electric current is applied.

With 240 Bauxite with Sloppy + Electrode + Pure, we get 240 Aluminium Ingot. With 240 Bauxite with Alumina + Electrode + Mixed, we get 230 Aluminium Ingot. Unsurprisingly, without external Silica, regular Alumina Solution is less efficient than Sloppy Alumina. With the same amount of Bauxite with Sloppy + Default + Pure, we get 216 Aluminium Ingot.

Jul 19, 2022The Bayer Process, developed by Carl Josef Bayer. is the principal industrial means of refining bauxite to produce alumina (aluminium oxide). In this process, aluminium ore is treated with concentrated sodium hydroxide to form a soluble sodium aluminate. Sodium aluminate is filtered, and the filtrate on heating with water gives aluminium hydroxide.

## Bauxite and Alumina Statistics and Information - USGS
Bauxite is a naturally occurring, heterogeneous material composed primarily of one or more aluminum hydroxide minerals, plus various mixtures of silica, iron oxide, titania, aluminosilicate, and other impurities in minor or trace amounts. The principal aluminum hydroxide minerals found in varying proportions with bauxites are gibbsite and the

##  30 Bauxite and Alumina - Usgs
Domestic Production and Use: In 2019, the quantity of bauxite consumed was estimated to be 5.1 million tons, 30% more than that reported in 2018, with an estimated value of about $162 million. About 73% of the bauxite was refined by the Bayer process for alumina or aluminum hydroxide, and the remainder went to products such as abrasives,

## Carl Josef Bayer
Carl Josef Bayer (also Karl Bayer, March 4, 1847 - October 4, 1904) was an Austrian chemist who invented the Bayer process of extracting alumina from bauxite, essential to this day to the economical production of aluminium.. Bayer had been working in Saint Petersburg to develop a method to provide alumina to the textile industry that used it as a fixing agent in the dyeing of cotton.
