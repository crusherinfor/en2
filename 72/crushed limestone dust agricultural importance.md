## Mag-Lime and Superfine Aglime | Texas Crushed Stone Co.
Agricultural limestone sold by Texas Crushed Stone Company is produced at the Georgetown quarry. A typical analysis of the stone is as follows: 87-92% Calcium Carbonate. 9-12% Magnesium Carbonate. .5-1% Other Elements.

## Limestone: The Calcium Carbonate Chemical Sedimentary Rock - Geology
Limestone is a material of national importance, and resource sterilization can result in a longer haul at a higher cost from quarry to customer. Limestone Production Patterns. Most of the limestone that is mined is crushed for aggregate. The majority of U.S. crushed stone production has come from limestone for at least the last 40 years.
