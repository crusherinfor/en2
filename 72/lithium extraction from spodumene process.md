The potential battery-grade lithium hydroxide refining facility will process, refine and manufacture battery materials, Tesla said in. It is one of the largest lithium reserves in the world, with an estimated 8 million tons. The mines there already supply a third of the world's lithium need, and they are boosting production. John.

## The Role of Calcination in the Extraction of Lithium from Spodumene
Spodumene ore naturally occurs in the crystal structure of monoclinic alpha form (Î±-form). In order to extract lithium from the ore via the leaching process, however, the ore's crystal structure must be in the tetragonal beta form (Î²-form).Â¹ This conversion is achieved through decrepitation, or the shattering of the crystal structure.

## Spodumene
Lithium is extracted from spodumene by fusing in acid after roasting to convert it to the more reactive Î²-spodumene. The advantage of spodumene as a lithium source compared to brine sources is the higher lithium concentration, at the expense of a higher extraction cost. In 2016, the price was forecast to be $/ton for years to come.

However, this process generates huge quantities of waste residue and needs high-temperature pretreatment. The process can be optimized if other high-value elements are found in spodumene deposits, residual lithium can be recycled during mining and processing, and energy savings can be achieved.

## Processing Spodumene by Froth Flotation for Lithium Extraction
Lithium Ore (Spodumene) Flotation. The conditioned pulp is diluted to approximately 20% solids for flotation in "Sub-A" Flotation Machines of standard steel construction. The cell to cell type machine with spitzkasten and froth paddles is used as well as the open-flow type. The open-flow machine has some advantage in coarse sand handling

Abstract. [en] This paper outlines a novel development: Outotec Lithium Hydroxide Process, a proprietary technology for spodumene concentrates refining. The new process offers a fast throughput, direct leach process for spodumene concentrates to produce battery grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate product. The process is also environmentally.

## Extraction of lithium from spodumene - Murdoch University
As the next part of this study the common method of extraction of lithium from spodumene was studied. Sample of synthesized Î²-spodumene was mixed with concentrated sulfuric acid and roasted at temperatures between 200 and 300 Â°C. This process was followed by water leaching at 50 Â°C for 1 hour.
