## Process of Steel-making from Iron Ore
Its production process is basically similar, melting pig iron into hot metal and then adding some substances in the hot metal, such as oxygen, and iron ore, which makes it react with the carbon in the hot metal so as to reduce the carbon content in the hot metal. Then pour the purified hot metal into the mold and make it into steel after cooling.

## Steel production: from iron ore to functional industrial products. - Vepica
How steel is made. First, the raw materials, either iron ore or scrap iron (depending on the process), are converted into molten steel. The ore-based process uses a blast furnace or smelter and the scrap-based process uses an electric arc furnace. Next, the molten steel is poured and solidified in a continuous caster.

## Ironmaking 101 - From Ore to Iron with Blast Furnaces
Iron ores with lower iron content such as taconite are first processed to concentrate the iron level and drive off volatile impurities. The iron ore is dressed or crushed into 0.5-1 in. chunks, which increases surface area for reactions. Magnetic separation is used to remove some of the undesirable minerals or gangue in the crushed ore.

## Iron Ore Processing Plant With 50 Years Experiences
The HIsarna steelmaking process is a process of primary steelmaking in which iron ore is processed almost directly into steel. The process is based on a new type of blast furnace called a Cyclone Converter Furnace, which makes it possible to skip the process of manufacturing pig iron pellets, a necessary step in the basic oxygen steelmaking
