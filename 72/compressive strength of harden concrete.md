## Advantages and disadvantages of reinforced concrete
The biggest disadvantage of reinforced concrete is that it is quite expensive. The higher its quality the more costly it becomes. The concrete is unable to be custom designed to suit the needs and requirements of the people. It has been found that the concrete is often not able to meet the specific needs of the building.

The w/c is the single most important factor governing the strength of concrete. High w/c implies high porosity, and thus lowered strength. The trend shown in Figure 1 for the dependence of compressive strength on the w/c is true for most concretes. The Abram's law is used to generalize the strength - w/c relationship.

The compressive strength of hardened concrete is one of the most important and useful properties of concrete. In most of the structural uses, the concrete is used mainly to resist the compressive stresses. In situations where the shear or tension strength is of importance, the compressive strength is usually used as a measure of these

## Concrete Under Uniaxial Stress Stress-Strain Curve of Hardened Concrete 
The short-term properties of concrete such as elastic modulus, shear strength, tensile, compressive strength and the stress-strain characteristics are expressed in terms of the uniaxial cube compressive strength of a 15cm x 15cm cube, moist cured for 28 days. This compressive strength is used as the design basis.

Background • Concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials in civil engineering ( buildings, bridges, tunnels, roads, air fields, ports, dams, etc ) • Concrete is a composite material made of aggregates (crushed stone), sand, cement and water. It derives its strength from the binding capacity of cement when it gets hydrated. • The strength of concrete depends on the

Concrete slabs are also the most efficient for hydronic radiant heating systems, as the thermal mass of the slab helps hold heat. Concrete slab floors do require that all subgrade utility rough ins be completed before the slab is poured and be accurately located. Retrofits for plumbing or mechanical changes later can be difficult and costly.

## What Are The Properties Of Concrete? - [Fresh And Hardened State]
1. Strength of Concrete. I hope this is the only test that most of us would remember studying in college. The strength of concrete is nothing but the concrete's resistance capacity to bear the compression load after it has hardened. The strength of concrete will gradually increase from day one and attains its max strength on day 28.

## Compressive Strength of Concrete after 7 and 28 days
The compressive strength of concrete is about 4000 psi. Definition. Compressive strength of concrete is the Strength of hardened concrete measured by the compression test. The compression strength of concrete is a measure of the concrete's ability to resist loads which tend to compress it.

## 5 Methods for On-Site Evaluation of Concrete Strength
On-site Evaluation of Concrete Strength. Concrete strength (compressive strength) is by far the most important property of concrete. It represents the mechanical characteristics of concrete; The 28 days compressive strength of concrete cylinders or cube samples has widely been accepted as the minimum specified concrete strength in most design codes (ACI 318-14, CSA A23.3-14).

## Water to Cement Ratio | Relation | Graph | Engineering Intro
Air voids in concrete depends on the water to cement ratio. There is an increase in air voids with the increase in weight of water. When this situation happens, then strength of concrete drops down. Hardened concrete contains about 1% of air voids. In a hardened state concrete, strength is inversely proportional to the water/cement ratio.
