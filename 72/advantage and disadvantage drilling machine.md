## Twist Drill: Definition, Nomenclature, Type, Advantages, [Notes & PDF]
A twist drill is basically a cylindrical piece of steel with special grooves. One end of the cylinder is pointed and the other end is so shaped that it can be attached to the drilling machine. The grooves are usually called flutes. The flutes formed by twisting a flat piece of steel into a cylindrical shape and such types of cylindrical shape drills are called twist drills.

## CNC Milling: Advantages and Disadvantages Clearly Explained
A CNC milling machine features a table that automatically moves (or rotates) the workpiece on different planes so the cutting tool can work on it. Unlike manual lathes, a CNC milling machine operates by converting a 3D CAD model into a set of computer instructions, which is then used to dictate the tooling's actions and movements automatically.
