## History of the iron and steel industry in the United States
The US iron and steel industry has paralleled the industry in other countries in technological developments. In the 1800s, the US switched from charcoal to coal in ore smelting, adopted the Bessemer process, and saw the rise of very large integrated steel mills.In the 20th century, the US industry successively adopted the open hearth furnace, then the basic oxygen steelmaking process.

The first is typically the least complicated, and has a 1:1 ratio of ore to ingot. For example, 24 iron ores go in a blast furnace and turn into 24 ingots with fuel. The second step adds more complexity but increases the output. For iron, tier 2 takes 18x iron ore, processes them and then combines with coke to yield 24 ingots.
