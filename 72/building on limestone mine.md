## Where Is Limestone Mined - Realonomics
Where Is Limestone Mined? Limestone is most often mined from a quarry. However underground limestone mines are found at places in the central and eastern United States especially in and near cities. Underground mining of lime- stone has some advantages over surface quarrying and will probably increase in the future.
