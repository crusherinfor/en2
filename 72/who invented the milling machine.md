## A Look into the History of Milling Machines - Summit Machine Tool
Each step in the development of the machine made producing identical products easier. In 1818, Eli Whitney, also known as the inventor of the cotton gin, created what has been referenced as the first milling machine. Yet, his milling machine was merely an updated and improved version of the machine invented by Rehe and Terry.

What was the name of the machine that was powered by water? Richard Arkwright developed the water frame around 1775. The machines could not be operated by hand and needed to be driven by water wheels. "These spinning machines were driven by water power at Arkwright's Cromford mill, hence the name of Water Frame.

## Top 9 Milling Machines of 2020 | Video Review
It is believed that milling machines date back to the 1700s, although it is unclear exactly when they were first invented, or by whom. They are very similar to lathes, so the earliest models were most likely just variations on the typical lathe machine. Milling machines became a separate class of tools sometime between 1814 and 1818.
