Bauxite. In 2017, China was the top producer of bauxite with almost half of the world's production, followed by Russia, Canada, and India. Although aluminium demand is rapidly increasing, known reserves of its bauxite ore are sufficient to meet the worldwide demands for aluminium for many centuries.

Bauxite is a type of sediment rock with highest content of aluminum. It is the world's principal source of aluminum and gallium. Bauxite contains gibbsite, boehmite, diaspore, and 2 iron containing ores haemetite and geoethite. Bauxite is mined using strip mining method as the ores are found near surfaces of terrains.

## Bauxite mining in the United States
Bauxite forms by the weathering of aluminum-rich and silica-poor rocks in hot, humid, climates, at places with good drainage. Under the proper conditions, weathering disintegrates the aluminium silicate minerals, and dissolves and removes the silica, creating bauxite. The mined US bauxite deposits have all been in the southeastern United States.

The alumina is extracted from the bauxite by means of the
