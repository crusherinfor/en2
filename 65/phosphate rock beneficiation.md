## Innovations in beneficiation technology for low grade phosphate rocks 
As high grade deposits of phosphate rock are being depleted day by day in the world, future sources will be derived from low grade rocks containing various impurities. Low grade phosphate rocks are not suitable for direct use in acidulation plants unless their tricalcium phosphate (TCP) content is increased to 70% or more, using conventional methods such as crushing, screening, and drying, or

In the beneficiation of Florida phosphate rock, flotation plays a predominant role because it is the most economical way to separate the phosphate values from the sand and other impurities contained in the matrix. Typically, the matrix is washed and deslimed at 150 mesh. The material finer than 150 mesh is pumped to clay settling ponds.
