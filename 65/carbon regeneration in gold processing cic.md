##  v117n8a13 Gold CIP and CIL process optimization in a capital  - SciELO
The well-known carbon-in-pulp (CIP) and carbon-in-leach (CIL) gold recovery processes are fairly robust. Considering the constantly changing characteristics of run-of-mine (ROM) ore, a robust process is in general a great advantage for a mineral processing plant. The disadvantage, however, is that because less input is required from operators and

## What Is CIP and CIL?
In CIP process, leaching and adsorption are two operations, the leaching tank is used for cyanide leaching of the slurry, and the carbon slurry tank is used for adsorption of gold by activated carbon. In CIL process, leaching and adsorption of slurry is an operation. These two steps are carried out in the same tank, so it is generally referred

Basic Parts Of Carbon In Leach Plant. basic parts of carbon in leach plant gold plant will be that of the leaching and carbon in pulp circuit CIP The reagent and utilities operating costs associated with leaching adsorption elution and regeneration would typically make up some 15 of total operating cost whilst the capital costs associated with these areas is about 16 of the total .

## The Magic Activated Carbon- How Does Cyanidation Process Extract Gold?
Typical Processing flowchart of gold CIL. The only difference between CIL and CIP is that CIP uses active carbon to adsorb gold after leaching, while CIL put active carbon into the leaching tank
