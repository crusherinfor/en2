## higher heating value of crushed ore
1/29/2020· The stored energy potential within coal is described as the calorific value, heating value, or heat content. It's measured in British thermal units Btu or millijoules per kilogram MJ/kg. A Btu is the amount of heat that will warm approximately 0.12 U.S. gallonsa pound of waterby 1 degree Fahrenheit at sea level.

## Beneficiation of Heat-Treated Crushed Brown Coal for  - SpringerLink
The rational use of natural resources and efficient energy consumption are two basic requirements of EU Directive 2008/1/EC. It is expected that the techniques for brown coal pre-drying will result in increased energy efficiency of enterprises of up to 5% and upgrading of heat-treated brown coal will increase energy efficiency by the same value.

## What is a Heating Value? - Definition from Corrosionpedia
Heating value is the amount of heat obtained when fuel or some other substance of a specific unit quantity is combusted. There are two types of heating values: The lower heating value (net) is the difference between combustion and latent heat of vaporization of the water vapors formed from combustion. The upper heating value (gross) is the heat
