This type of mining is used to recover steeply dipping orebodies in competent rock. The ore is removed from the stope as soon as it is mined. Sublevel stoping and big-hole stoping are the important variants in use today. A few examples of commodities mined by this method include iron and lead/zinc. 8.3.1: Room and Pillar Method.

In this method, you must drill a downwards ramp next to the ore deposit. This ramp should run from the surface level down as far as the ore deposit goes. Next, you can drill a horizontal cut from one side of the ore deposit to the other. Miners typically refer to such cuts as drifts.

Shrinkage stoping refers to any overhand method in which the stope is kept full of broken ore until it is completed. The miners stand on top of the broken ore and work at the back. As broken ore takes up more space than ore in a solid mass, about 35 to 40 per cent, of it must be drawn to leave room for working.

In most underground mining methods, deep vertical tunnels called shafts are drilled into the ground, along with a set of horizontal tunnels called drifts from the shaft bottom to access the ore. Then, longwall and continuous miners break up the ore deposit, which is transported back to the surface by conveyors.

Two main methods of underground mining are practiced in Pennsylvania: Room-and-Pillar: Generally used for seams that are relatively flat or gently dipping. As the 'room' is mined, large 'pillars' of coal are left behind to support the weight of the overburden and rock layers above. This type of mining is the traditional method of underground

Once a decision has been made to go underground, the specific mining method selected depends on the size, shape, and orientation of the ore body, the grade of mineralization, the strength of the rock materials, and the depths involved. For example, if the ore is very high grade or carries a high price, then a higher cost method can be used.

What Is Underground Mining Method. Underground mining is used to extract ore from underneath the floor of the earth safely, economically, and with as little waste as possible. The access from the floor to an underground mine can be thru a horizontal or vertical tunnel, referred to as an adit, shaft, or wane.

## Underground Coal Mining Methods In India
Longwall mining is a method of underground mining, usually used in coal mining. The method is fairly basic. A tunnel is created by basically cutting back the coal with a rotating drum and shearers. The coal fragments are then conveyed up to the surface. A series of hydraulic jacks (aka., chocks, are used to support the cavity wall, temporarily).

Oct 26, 2021What Is Underground Mining Method. Underground mining is used to extract ore from underneath the floor of the earth safely, economically, and with as little waste as possible. The access from the floor to an underground mine can be thru a horizontal or vertical tunnel, referred to as an adit, shaft, or wane.

## Mining Method - Resolution Copper
The most viable way to recover the ore body is by a well-established underground mining method called block caving. Block caving is safe, environmentally sound, and cost-effective for mining a large, deep orebody. In block caving, a large section of ore is initially undercut by drilling and blasting, causing it to collapse under its weight.

The underground mining methods we use include room and pillar, narrow vein stoping and large-scale mechanised mining. Room and pillar mining is a style of mining where tunnels are driven in a chess board pattern with massive square pillars between them which are gradually cut away as the work proceeds. We use this for mining coal.
