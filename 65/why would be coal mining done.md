## PA Mining History - Department of Environmental Protection
During 1997 over 73 million tons of bituminous coal was mined in Pennsylvania. More than 75% of the total production came from underground mines. The ratio of underground production versus total production has steadily increased over the past decade and is currently at levels not seen since the mid-1950s. The annual surface mining production

2.3 Strip Mining. Strip mining is employed in coal reserves where the overburden is removed in rectangular blocks in plan view called pits or strips. The pits are parallel and adjacent to each other. Strip mining is fundamentally different from contour or area mining on how the overburden is displaced, called spoil handling.

Uses of Coal. Description. Power Generation. Steam coal, also known as thermal coal, provides a source of electricity. Power plants ground steam coal into a powder and fire it into a boiler to produce heat. The heat is used to turn water into steam. The steam powers a turbine that, along with an alternator, generates electricity.

Coal miners were paid by the amount and quality of the coal they produced, and they could be fined if there was too much "slack" (the smaller pieces). Quality coal was what owners required, but managers determined the standards for quality coal. Owners could keep costs low by claiming the coal was of a poor quality or rigging their scales.

The fires can be caused by short-circuits in the electrical equipment or mechanical faults in the machines used. Since coal is already a very combustible material, the effects of a fire inside the mine will be especially devastating.

Coal camp living conditions were often squalid, with social life dominated by the company and basic freedoms of speech, movement, and assembly restricted by private mine guards and company-paid sheriffs. Mining coal was incredibly dangerous work. During the industrial coal boom between 1880 and 1923, more than 70,000 miners died on the job.

## Strip Mining: A Destructive Way of Coal Extraction
Surface or strip mining damages and pollutes ecosystems to a great degree. This is because by definition the process of strip mining involves striping away trees, plants and topsoil so that the coal can be accessed underneath. This means that surface mining destroys mountain tops, landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats.

Why do we need coal? Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants bituminous coal subbituminous coal or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam which drives a turbine which produces electricity.

Therefore, Indian firms that require thermal coal as their fuel for producing power blends imported coal with domestic coal to compensate for the lower quality. ( The term GCV means the quantity of energy released by burning 1 kg of coal. Higher the GCV, better the quality of the coal. Lower the ash content, the better the quality of the coal.)
