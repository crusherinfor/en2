Gold sank to the Earth's core during the planet's formation. It's only accessible today because of asteroid bombardment. Theoretically, it's possible to form gold by the nuclear processes of fusion, fission, and radioactive decay. It's easiest for scientists to transmute gold by bombarding the heavier element mercury and producing gold via decay.

The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum.

## Gold Refining Step by Step Process: A Useful Discussion
Gold refining is a group of processes to pull out and set the precious metal apart from recycled elements (such as electronics and jewelry), mined materials, etc. The two most popular refining techniques to extract pure gold include the Wohlwill process and the Miller process.. Whereas the Miller process produces around 99.5% of pure gold, the Wohlwill process has managed to enhance the purity

## Gold Processing Methods & Gold Ore Extraction
Next. Of all the methods of extracting gold & processing it from its ore, I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study. The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation, cyanidation and gravity concentration. Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.

## Third Gold Processing for Non-Metallurgists Workshop a huge success!
The workshop is designed to give a broad overview of gold processing technology to non-technical employees within the gold industry. The course is a condensed, one and a half day version of the traditional two day course, aimed at geologists, mining engineers, laboratory staff, accountants and all other non-metallurgists in the gold industry.
