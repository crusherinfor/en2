Although quartz is more resistant to weathering than many other minerals, it still weathers with many impacts on plants and soils. Dissolved silica from quartz and other silicate minerals is used by some plants for structural tissues. As an example, rice accumulates silica to strengthen its stem (Lanning, 1963). Dissolved silica also can affect
