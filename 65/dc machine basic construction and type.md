## DC Motor Working Principle, Construction and Diagram Explanation
The DC motor working principle is that a current-carrying conductor experiences a mechanical force when placed in a magnetic field. This is known as the Lorentz force. And the direction of this force is given by FLEMING'S LEFT-HAND RULE. DC motor working principle is similar to the working principle of a DC generator.
