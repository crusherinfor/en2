## Graded limestonephabet
It is the product of high temperature decomposition of limestone, CaCO 3. CaO is principally used as agricultural lime and is known as quicklime. Calcium oxide reacts with water as follows: CaO + H 2 O → Ca ( OH) 2. The resulting product, calcium hydroxide, is likewise used for agricultural purposes and is known as slaked lime..
