## Gypsum Mining and Processing in Nigeria: the Opportunity.
One such mineral with great industry use and but largely underdeveloped in Nigeria, is gypsum. About one billion tones of gypsum deposits are spread over many sites in Nigeria. It is an important input for the production of cement. It is also used for the production of Plaster of Paris (P0P) and classroom chalk, etc.

## Gypsum Mining in Garbutt - townofwheatland
At first, the Garbutt family and others conducted thriving businesses of mining, grinding and selling gypsum as "land plaster," believed to enhance the growth of crops. By the late 1800s many other uses for gypsum had been developed, including water lime cement, plaster board and gypsum blocks. In 1900 the Lycoming Calcining Company bought

Natural Gypsum. While natural gypsum as used in a cement mill is usually a combination of CaSO4⋅2H2O and CaSO4 (gypsum and anhydrite respectively), synthetic alternatives may consist of a slurry of CaSO4⋅2H2O, a dry plasterboard product (also CaSO4⋅2H2O) or a powder or cake of anhydrite.

It takes a long time for the cement to hydrate and harden and needs enough water to ensure hydration. For ordinary Portland cement, the addition of gypsum is kept between 3% and 4%, while for quick-setting cement, the gypsum addition can be 2.5%. If your cement contains a lot of C3A, it may react with excess sulfate in gypsum to form ettringite.
