Some RPs are calcined during beneficiation to remove impurities, to increase P concentration, or to make Fe- and Al-phosphate impurities more available to plants (Milnes 1976). These RPs may also be used as direct application fertilisers but the effect of calcination on the agronomic effectiveness is likely to be adverse (Khasawneh et al. 1980).

## Review on Beneficiation Techniques and Reagents Used for Phosphate Ores
Phosphate ore is an important raw material for manufacturing fertilizers and phosphorous chemical products. While most of the phosphate resources cannot be directly treated as feed stock due to the low grade of P2O5 and high content of impurities. In order to obtain a qualified phosphate concentrate, the beneficiation of the low-grade phosphate ore is, hence, of great necessity.

## Beneficiation of refractory rock phosphate by calcination and flotation 
Separation of refractory rock phosphate (P2O5 = 11.5%) from the Dalir area, Iran, containing quartz, calcite and other impurities, by calcination and flotation processes has been successfully used to upgrade the phosphate values. Petrographic studies of this ore showed that collophanite was the major phosphate mineral and the main gangue minerals were calcite, dolomite and quartz. The results
