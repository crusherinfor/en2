## Conveyor Belt Scale Design - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Non-gravimetric methods are just becoming established in the industry. The basic components of a belt scale system are: Belt conveyor to convey the load over the scale. Scale suspension to transmit and direct the load force. Sensing device to measure the load force and belt speed. Integrating, totalizing and recording the scale output.

## Advantages and disadvantages of conveyorsln1000
Advantages of conveyor belts. A conveyor belt is an efficient way to move materials around a warehouse, and there are many advantages to using one. Here are four of the biggest: 1. Conveyor belts are fast and efficient. They can move large quantities of material quickly and efficiently, which saves time and money. 2. Conveyor belts are versatile.

DESIGNING A BULK CONVEYOR STARTS WITH UNDERSTANDING THE MATERIAL. Bulk density and repose angle are critical factors. Combined with the target tons per hour these let you size the conveyor in terms of width and feet per minute. These numbers aren't enough though. You also need to understand the characteristics of the material. For example, is it:
