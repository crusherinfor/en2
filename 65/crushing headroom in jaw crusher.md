## Jaw Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Rose and English [9] determined the capacity of a jaw crusher by considering the time taken and the distance travelled by the particles between the two plates after being subjected to repeat crushing forces between the jaws. Therefore, dry particles wedged between level A and level B (Figure 4.4) would leave the crusher at the next reverse movement of the jaw.

## Six ways to take primary crushing underground - Australian Mining
One question often overlooked is: if you lift something out of the crusher, where do you put it? Sufficient floor space and headroom are essential. One tip for saving space is to build a hole in the floor for the main shaft. Then, you lay the pitman from the jaw crusher on its side to work on bearings or place the gyratory main shaft upright.

## Tips for maintaining efficiency in crushing circuits - Quarry
In practice, many jaw crushers are not fed to their design capacity; this is because the subsequent processing plant does not have sufficient capacity to handle the volume of material that would be produced if the jaw crusher were working to capacity. Crushing setting: Efficiency. Ideally, the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6:1.

## Below the surface: Setting up an underground primary jaw crusher
Jaw crushers are the most common solution in underground applications when the throughput is below 1000 tonnes per hour, depending somewhat on the scalping solutions. Above 1000 tph, primary gyratory crushers are an option. After the throughput reaches 2000 tph, jaw crushers are very rare, with the exception of a parallel plant layout.
