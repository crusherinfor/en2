## Why does the kiln supporting roller bearing heat up
The heating of the supporting roller bearing of the rotary kiln is mainly related to its poor lubrication state and abnormal load. When signs of fever appear, equipment management personnel must first quickly cool down according to the heating condition to avoid equipment burnout, and stop the machine for maintenance in time, starting with common main factors such as lubrication status and

3. Support roller adjustments to raise gear out of the pinion. (1)Always move the rollers in equally on all piers and avoid moving the drive pier only. Moving drive pier only will over time change the centerline of the unite with the support rollers and will cause maintenances issues. (2)Use a 4:1 ratio on the roller to move the desired distance.
