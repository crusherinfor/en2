## Uses of limestone in Nigeria
Crushed limestone provides a base for roads and asphalt concrete, as well as a ballast for railroads. Limestone creates geological formations that are perfect for storing petroleum. Limestone is a reagent in desulphurisation of flue-gas, which means that exposure of limestone to sulphur causes a reaction.
