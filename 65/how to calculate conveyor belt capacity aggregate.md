## Conveyor belt design
The clean, smooth steering surface improves the efficiency and durability of conveyor belts . The working surface of the mobile pulley must not be too smooth or too rough (the surface must not be wrinkled!), As this can cause excessive belt wear, noise and premature belt failure. It is recommended to make a work surface with a roughness Ra = 1.
