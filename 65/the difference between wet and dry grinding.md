What is difference between wet grinder and dry grinder? The particles ride along in the liquid and are crushed among the grinding media. Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation.
