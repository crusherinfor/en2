## What Is Crushed Concrete? - Modern Design
Concrete is not biodegradable and won't decompose, so it sits there taking up space. This can eventually cause environmental problems. A better alternative is to recycle the concrete by breaking it up into chunks and crushing it. The new crushed concrete can be used in all sorts of applications including to make new concrete.

When placed and compacted, the Portland cement in the concrete actually resets and provides an extremely tight, high strength subbase. Utilizing RCP also helps minimize waste and disposal costs of demolished concrete. Please contact Dave Byers at or by emailing dbyers@brkreider.

Sep 14, 2020Recycled crushed concrete begins by breaking down original structures. This can include just about any of the normal concrete structures that would go into landfills, like building slabs, curbs, foundation, and any sort of concrete structure. The breakdown begins by using industrial crushing equipment to demolish the existing structure.

It needs to dry and then stay dry to avoid flooring problems. This is why a vapor barrier under concrete is essential.. Step 1.
