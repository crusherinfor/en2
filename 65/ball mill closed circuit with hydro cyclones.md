## why is required that the ball mills be operated in a closed
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5-10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.

## Closed circuit ball mill - Basics revisited - ScienceDirect
The reference point is a conventional ball mill circuit in closed circuit with cyclones operating at 250% circulating load and having 38% of fine material reporting to cyclone underflow, resulting in a classification efficiency of 50%. This efficiency was chosen as an industrial practice "average" from the data presented in Fig. 6.
