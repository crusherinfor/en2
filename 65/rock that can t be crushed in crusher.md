Both are the same cost at $5 a ton. I am leaning towards the crushed rock as it allows water to drain down through it whereas the crushed rock/clay base mix will pack down and not allow water to drain through it but wash off of it.

For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 Ã— 1.7 = 78 cm.

The aluminum can crusher can take cans up to 12 oz size, so it will not be able to crush larger 16 oz cans. As this is a tool made from plastic it can only be used to compress aluminum cans and shouldn't be used to crush cans from any harder materials such as tin or steel. The unit itself is very easy to operate, but the real advantage comes with the can collection bin.
