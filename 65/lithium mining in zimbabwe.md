## Zimbabwe Holds Potential Lithium Deposits | E & MJ
Zimbabwe's grade of spodumene is particularly good compared to its peers worldwide; about 6.7 grams per metric ton (g/mt), compared with a global average of 5.5 g/mt. To extract lithium, the feedstock mineral goes through a multistep process. Crushed into a pulp, and put through a floatation process, it is a tricky process to get right.

Bolivia: Pursuing Sustainable Lithium Mining.May 16, 2022. By Isabel Vander Molen. Between 2015 and 2017 alone, demand for the mineral lithium increased 10 percent each year and prices for lithium nearly tripled, with global usage reaching 40,000 tons in 2017.This demand shows no signs of slowing, with Goldman Sachs predicting that for every one percent.

The project is generally regarded as potentially the largest undeveloped lithium bearing pegmatite in Zimbabwe. Zulu comprises 14 mineral claims covering a surface area of 3.5 km2 which are prospective for lithium and tantalum mineralisation. The Zulu Project was first pegged in 1955 and intensely explored until the early 1960s.
