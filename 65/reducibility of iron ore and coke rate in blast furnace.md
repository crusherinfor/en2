## Factors affecting Coke rate in a Blast Furnace - IspatGuru
During the production of hot metal in a blast furnace, BF coke rate is influenced in many ways. High ash content in BF coke means charging the blast furnace with more slag forming material which is to be fluxed to form slag. This results into higher slag volumes. As per thumb rule 1 % reduction in the ash content of the BF coke results into

## Why Use Coke for Blast Furnace Ironmaking not Use Coal Directly?
The high-temperature CO2 gas reacts with the carbon in the coke to form CO, and the CO further reduces the iron ore to form molten iron. Carbon supply: The carbon content of pig iron is about 4%, all from blast furnace coke, accounting for 7%-9% of coke carbon content. Heating: The combustion of coke, injected fuel and external hot air provide
