## Crushing Characteristics of Coarse Aggregates for Asphalt Mixtures 
In this study, a Marshall impact hammer was applied to investigate the crushing behavior of coarse aggregates without the addition of fine aggregate, filler and bitumen. About 800 g of coarse aggregate with a single size of 9.5-13.2 mm was carefully put into the steel mold with an inside diameter of 101.6 mm and a height of 75 mm.

## Aggregate Crushing Value IS: 2386 PART- 4 - Civil Engineering Calculators
Aggregate used in road construction, should be strong enough to resist crushing under traffic wheel loads. If the aggregates are weak the stability of the pavement structure is likely to be adversely affected. The strength of coarse aggregates is assessed by aggregate crushing test.

##  Aggregates for Concrete
Aggregates may be broadly classi fied as natural or artificial, both with respect to source and to method of preparation. Natural sands and gravels are the product of weathering and the action of wind or water, while manufactured crushed fine aggregate and crushed stone coarse and fine aggregate are produced by crushing natural stone.

## Numerical simulation of influence of coarse aggregate crushing on 
The compressive strength shows a downward trend as the amount of crushable coarse aggregates increases. However, a small amount of coarse aggregate crushing can increase the compressive strength of normal concrete. This is the effect of filling the pores inside the concrete. Coarse aggregate crushing increases the volume of ITZ.

AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE 1.Objective The aggregate crushing value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. With aggregate of aggregate crushing value 30 or higher, the result may be anomalous, and in such cases the ten percent fines value should be determined instead.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test | Crushing Value of Aggregate - Civiconcepts
The aggregate Crushing Value Test is an important test to be performed on aggregate.The strength of aggregate parent rock is determined by preparing cylindrical shape specimens of size 25 mm in diameter and 25 mm in height.. This cylinder is subjected to compressive stress.Depending on the type of parent rock gives the different crushing values of aggregate as a compressive strength varying

## Coarse Aggregates in Construction | Types and Uses
Aggregates that cannot pass through the IS Sieve of 4.75mm are called coarse aggregates. They are crushed stones or naturally occurring gravel used in making concrete. Their maximum size can go up to 63mm. Coarse aggregates are usually formed by blasting the stone quarries. Though sometimes, they are also hand-crushed.

## Test on Aggregates, lab tests, fine aggregate test, coarse aggregate 
Aggregate used in road construction, should be strong enough to resist crushing under traffic wheel loads. If the aggregates are weak the stability of the pavement structure is likely to be adversely affected. The strength of coarse aggregates is assessed by aggregate crushing test.
