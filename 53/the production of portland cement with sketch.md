## Portland Cement : Composition, Production and Properties - Google Books
Portland cement is one of the most traditional of construction materials. Rising costs of the energy required for its manufacture and the increasing interest in understanding the mechanisms of concrete deterioration, as well as the importance of optimising the use of Portland cement in high quality concrete, have continued to sustain interest in this important material.

## Portland cement clinker - Understanding Cement
Portland cement clinker - overview. Portland cement clinker is a dark grey nodular material made by heating ground limestone and clay at a temperature of about 1400 °C - 1500 °C. The nodules are ground up to a fine powder to produce cement, with a small amount of gypsum added to control the setting properties. This page gives a thumbnail sketch.

Steps and phases. Production of Portland cement is a complex technological process that consists of two basic steps. In the first, through heat processing entering raw materials are fundamentally altered creating cement clinker. In the second, by grinding and milling clinker wit gypsum the final product - cement - is manufactured.

## Portland Cement - Pavement Interactive
Cement is the chief ingredient in cement paste - the binding agent in portland cement concrete (PCC).It is a hydraulic cement that, when combined with water, hardens into a solid mass. Interspersed in an aggregate matrix it forms PCC. As a material, portland cement has been used for well over 175 years and, from an empirical perspective, its behavior is well-understood.

Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement, in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica-bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silicates.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year, and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually defines the capacity of the cement plant.
