## The Best Ratio of Cement to Sand (for Concrete Crafts)
As long as you know the correct mixture ratio of cement to sand and/or possibly an aggregate to use, you'll have the perfect mix. When it comes to making concrete crafts, there is a perfect recipe of cement to sand. And based on my tests below, the best ratio is 3 parts cement to 1 part sand (3:1).

## When something is cementing?sewing
Cementing materials are raw materials that possess excellent setting and hardening properties when mixed to a paste with water. There are two types of cementing materials, hydraulic and nonhydraulic. Hydraulic cementing materials set and harden in water. An example of a hydraulic cementing material is Portland cement.

Aggregates. Aggregates are inert granular materials such as sand, gravel, or crushed stone that, along with water and portland cement, are an essential ingredient in concrete. For a good concrete mix, aggregates need to be clean, hard, strong particles free of absorbed chemicals or coatings of clay and other fine materials that could cause the

A cement is a binder, a substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together.

## How Cement is Made | Cement Ingredients | History of Cement - CivilJungle
Cement is manufactured through a closely controlled chemical combination of calcium, silicon, aluminum, iron and other ingredients. Common materials used to manufacture cement include limestone, shells, and chalk or marl combined with shale, clay, slate, blast furnace slag, silica sand, and iron ore.

cement, in general, adhesive substances of all kinds, but, in a narrower sense, the binding materials used in building and civil engineering construction. Cements of this kind are finely ground powders that, when mixed with water, set to a hard mass. Setting and hardening result from hydration, which is a chemical combination of the cement compounds with water that yields submicroscopic
