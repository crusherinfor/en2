## Europe's brown coal-free rural regions | EIT
Aug 23, 2021The brown coal market is still significant in Europe. The mining of lignite is quantitatively much larger than that of hard coal, as much more coal is needed to produce the same amount of energy. 244 million tonnes of it was mined in Europe in 2020, most of it in Germany, which is the main producer. In 2018, 9 % of the total gross electricity

The total production of coal in Europe is about 151.4 million tons, translating to about 3.9% of the total coal produced in the world. Coal is the preferred source of energy for industrial purposes, especially in steel production and electricity generation, due to its low price compared to natural gas and oil.

The FDA defines raw sugar thus: " Raw sugar " is the term generally applied to the intermediate food product as it leaves the sugar factory mill for further refinement in sugar refineries before use as food. In general, raw sugar is unsuitable for human food use because it contains extraneous impurities which are removed in the refining process.
