Clay products . Clay products are one of the most important classes of structural materials. The raw materials used in their manufacture are clay blended with quartz, sand, chamatte (refractory clay burned at o C and crushed), slag, sawdust and pulverized coal. Structural clay products or building ceramics are basically fabricated by moulding, drying and burning a clay mass.

Dry sand is made by baking or drying the mold made from the green sand in a decent oven. The dry sand contains a mixture of 15% to 20% of clay and silica.

## Effect of Drying on Clay Clogging of Pervious Concrete
Clay drying may cause difficult-to-recover clogging due to two factors, namely, drying increases particle-to-particle cohesion and particle adhesion to pore walls, and drying causes particles to shrink to form aggregates that are larger than the pore size. This study facilitates the development of effective pavement maintenance strategies.

## Clay Firing Process | Tips
Air Dry Clay. Wet clay contains a large amount of water, a minimum of 25%, actually. When clay starts to dry, water evaporates from it. As this happens, the particles of clay are drawn closer together resulting in shrinkage. Many problems with clay are formed by uneven rates of drying, which create stresses in the clay.

Natural clay deposits exhibit nonhomogeneity and anisotropy in shear strength to a considerable degree. In order to take these into account, an analysis is presented herein for. .In the field, expansive clay soils can be easily recognized in the dry season by the deep cracks, in roughly polygonal patterns, in the ground surface (see Fig. 1). The zone of seasonal moisture.

## Drying process of clay ceramic materials: a review
Drying is a heat and mass transfer operation involving the removal of moisture, being an important and expensive step in the manufacturing process of several products. For ceramic materials, the drying process is necessary to remove the water that was added to the clay in the molding step and to provide the necessary strength to reduce the chances of failure during the product firing step.

## Drying and Firing Process << Bill Rowe's Pottery Page
DRYING/FIRING PROCESS. 1. Drying. As plastic clay dries, it shrinks 5%. Very plastic clay shrinks 8% as it dries. Shrinkage is slow and can create problems. The average plastic clay is 35 parts water to 100 parts clay. As humidity falls (in the atmosphere), below 100%, drying takes place. If an object is even, it will dry relatively evenly.
