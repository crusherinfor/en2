Statewide, the average production of coal per employee is 23 short tons per hour. This is the highest productivity in the nation and more than double the productivity of the next top coal-producing state. Between 1865 and January 1, 2022, more than 12.6 billion short tons of coal had been mined in Wyoming, most of it in the last 30 years.
