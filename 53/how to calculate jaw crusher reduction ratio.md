## Crusher Close Side Settings - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The reduction ratio is driven by the Crusher Close Side Setting. The actual minimum safe closed side setting of a crusher will vary somewhat, for any given crushing machine, depending upon the character of the material, the amount of fines in the feed, and whether the crusher is being operated under choke-feed or regulated feed conditions. It is possible, when all conditions are favourable, to

Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1, while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio. The finer the crushing, the smaller the reduction ratio. As a basic rule, jaw crushers are the primary crusher taking the mined aggregate and reducing it to a size that a cone crusher can accept.
