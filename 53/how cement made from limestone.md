But, the key is water. When cement reacts to water, it goes through a chemical reaction called hydration. During this reaction, nodes form on the surface of each of the cement particles. The nodes then expand and link up with other nodes. The nodes stick to the crushed rock and sand too and bind these ingredients.

## What is Cement and How it is Manufactured? - The Machine Design
A cement is a binding substance, used to bind other buildings or civil construction material like bricks, stones, gravels, tiles, etc. Cement can be set and hardened independently and can bind other building materials together. It is a very fine powder containing limestone, clay, silica, and alumina. Also contained with bauxite and iron oxide.

Most modern cement is Portland cement. To make Portland cement, cement manufacturers combine limestone with a silica source (like slag, fly ash, or clay) in a giant kiln. They then heat up the mixture to temperatures as high as 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. This drives all the water out of the mix as well as the carbon dioxide from the limestone.

## cement - History of cement | Britannica
Portland cement is a successor to a hydraulic lime that was first developed by John Smeaton in 1756 when he was called in to erect the Eddystone Lighthouse off the coast of Plymouth, Devon, England. The next development, taking place about 1800 in England and France, was a material obtained by burning nodules of clayey limestone.

## Cement Manufacturing Process: How the Cement is Made?
All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.
