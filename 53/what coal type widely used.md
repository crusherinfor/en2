## What Are The 4 Types Of Coal - Realonomics
Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants bituminous coal subbituminous coal or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam which drives a turbine which produces electricity.

## What Type Of Coal Is Best For Blacksmithing? - ToolsOwner
Bituminous coal is the best blacksmithing fuel. It burns cleanly, cokes up well, making fire management a breeze, and produces little clinker. Go for the kind that is metallurgical grade because it produces sufficient heat, low smoke, and low sulfur. If bituminous coal isn't available in your area, use charcoal.
