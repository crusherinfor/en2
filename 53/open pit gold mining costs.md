## Open-pit mining
Typical open cut grades. Gold is generally extracted in open-pit mines at 1 to 5 ppm (parts per million) but in certain cases, 0.75 ppm gold is economical. This was achieved by bulk heap leaching at the Peak Hill mine in western New South Wales, near Dubbo, Australia.. Nickel, generally as laterite, is extracted via open-pit down to 0.2%. Copper can be extracted at grades as low as 0.11% to 0.2%.

8.2.3.1 Open pit mining Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.

## Cost-efficient Transport for Open-pit Mines | E & MJ
TKF believes that many open-pit mine operators who are faced with rapidly rising production costs while using conventional transport concepts now have a genuine, cost-effective alternative. Dr. Franz Wolpers is the executive vice president for TKF's materials-handling business unit, and head of the company's central R&D division.
