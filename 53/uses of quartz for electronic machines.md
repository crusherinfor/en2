## What Exactly Is a Quartz Crystal, Anyways? A Look at Quartz Crystal 
This is the equivalent circuit of a quartz crystal: Let's be clear: A quartz crystal is a quartz crystal. If you hit the crystal with a hammer it won't break into an inductor, a resistor, and two capacitors. However, quartz crystals have (in my opinion rather mysterious) electromechanical characteristics that cause the crystal to behave, in

## How Quartz Watches Work | HowStuffWorks
During the 1970s, the "quartz watch" burst onto the scene as the newest high-tech gadget. Initially, these watches had red LED displays and they cost around $500 in the United States. Since then, the quartz watch has evolved so that either an LCD or a traditional mechanical (hour and minute hand) movement displays the time, and the price has fallen dramatically.

## How quartz watches and clocks work - Explain that Stuff
It's a type of quartz that gets its color from iron substituting for some of the silicon in pure quartz. Inside a quartz clock or watch, the battery sends electricity to the quartz crystal through an electronic circuit. The quartz crystal oscillates (vibrates back and forth) at a precise frequency: exactly 32768 times each second.
