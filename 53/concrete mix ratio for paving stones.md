## Concrete mix ratios - The Brew Cabin
Im after some advice from the experts on good ratios to create an easily workable and most importantly smooth concrete mix. Background wise, I will be filling wooden forms for cast in place concrete pavers. Say around 1m2 each. Approx 50mm thick. Will be finishing the pavers with white colour hardener.

Concrete in the 35/45 strength class is used for concrete paving in the Netherlands. An air-entrained concrete mix with a minimum cement content of 20 lb/ft 3 (320 kg/m 3) and a water- cement ratio no greater than 0.55 is used. The Netherlands has had no problems with alkali-silica reaction with its local aggregates.

Apr 24, 2022Water/cement ratio theory states that for a given combination of materials and as long as workable consistency is obtained, the strength of concrete at a given age depends on the w/c ratio. The lower the w/c ratio, the higher the concrete strength. All materials used for a design including the water quality should be to a high standard.

In terms of the ratio for concrete, it depends on what strength you are trying to achieve, but as a general guide a standard concrete mix would be 1 part cement to 2 parts sand to 4 parts aggregates. For foundations, a mix of 1 part cement to 3 parts sand to 6 parts aggregates can be used.

The standard ratio for average mortar mix is 3:1 or 4:1 for bricklaying. If you are using a pointing mix, then you should have a ratio of 1:4 or 1:5 mortar to sand. As for concrete, it depends on the strength you need it to be at. Usually, it is good practice to mix concrete at 1:2 mix to materials.

Often times additional reinforcements are added like fiber, wire mesh or rebar and in cold climates the air-entrainment value should be around 6%.
