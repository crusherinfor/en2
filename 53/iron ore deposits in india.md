## Iron Ore - Indian Minerals: Fuel, Metallic & Industrial
Haematite and magnetite are the most important iron ores in India. About 59% haematite ore deposits are found in the Eastern Sector while about 92% magnetite ore deposits occur in Southern Sector, especially in Karnataka. Of these, haematite is considered to be superior because of its higher grade. India has ~8% of the world's iron ore deposits.

## Iron ore | BHP
What is iron ore? Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted. There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red.

Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.
