## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Impacts of strip mining: Strip mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees, plants, and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways.

MORE EFFECTS OF ILLEGAL MINING . The illegal ASMG operations require the removal of overlying layers of surface vegetation, forest, and rock.  Again, the ASGM activities may force affected farmers to cultivate marginal crops. Gold and cocoa especially maintain an uneasy coexistence, with the two vying over land and labour, and galamsey is a
