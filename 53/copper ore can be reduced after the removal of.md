The double-sided copper foil is formed by controlling the dose of organic additives in electrolyte in the process of producing copper foil for lithium battery. During electrolysis, the cations in the electrolyte migrate to the cathode, and are reduced after obtaining electrons on the cathode. The anions are oxidized after migrating to the anode.

## Smelting
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore, to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

After concentration of ores, we must now extract metal from in it. This step will give us metal in its pure form i.e. the native form of metal. First, we must convert the ore to a suitable form. The metals need to be in an oxide form for the reduction process to be easier. Hence the ores are converted to oxides, so it is ideal for reduction.
