The year 2012 saw updates in blended cement spec ASTM C595. It covers two types of PLC cement: Type IL: Portland-Limestone Cement that is 5-15 percent limestone (by mass) Type IT: Ternary Blended Cements combining PC, pozzolan, limestone slag cement and limestone. For the period, United States PLC production exceeded two million tons.

Coplay Cement Company. From 1893 to 1904 the nine vertical kilns of the Coplay Cement Company were used for the production of portland cement. Built as an improvement in kiln technology over the bottle or dome kiln then in use, the 90 foot high vertical kilns had the advantage of producing a higher quality product than dome kilns and produced it on a continuous basis as well.

At least 50-60 per cent of limestone can be replaced by Belterra clay, which provides several advantages when compared with limestone quarrying. The clay has to be removed anyway, so it does not have to be extracted only for cement production. Furthermore, the burning process only requires 1250˚C - 200˚C less than for Portland cement.

Annual world production in 2013 was approximately 4 GT (of which, about half was in China). It is produced in kilns at around 1400 o C (2500 o F), and approximately 750 kg (1650 lb) of CO 2 are released for each tonne (2205 lb.) that is made.

Because the limestone is softer than the clinker it will grind preferentially, resulting in a cement with a better particle size distribution with less energy. The limestone also requires less processing and does not undergo calcination, so it releases less waste in its production. The resulting cement will perform at least as well as cements

## Engineers create world's first carbon-neutral cement out of algae
A lot of those emissions come from the production of cement, which is the second most consumed material on the planet behind water. Cement produces emissions in two main ways. One is through the chemical reactions that occur while sintering limestone and other materials to make "clinker," a key component of cement.
