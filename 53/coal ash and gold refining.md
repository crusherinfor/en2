## Gold Refining Step by Step Process: A Useful Discussion
The two most popular refining techniques to extract pure gold include the Wohlwill process and the Miller process. Whereas the Miller process produces around 99.5% of pure gold, the Wohlwill process has managed to enhance the purity up to 99.99%.

## gold processing - Refining | Britannica
Refining from scrap. The processing of gold scrap varies not only with the gold content but also with the amenability of the gold in the scrap to extraction. Thus, the bulk of the gold may be recovered by leaching techniques using cyanidation or aqueous chlorination, and the residue may then be treated by smelting to recover the balance.

The Refining Process. Refiners start with one of two types of gold: a doré bar or scrap. Doré bars are produced by miners and are about 80 percent pure. Refiners increase the purity by separating the other precious metals and less precious metals that are mined with it. Using induction heating, doré bars and scrap are turned into molten metal.

One thing to consider. If, by chance, you want to improve gold by absorbing oxides with flux, DO NOT USE SODA ASH. It is a reducer, and will put oxides right back in the alloy as clean metals. It's used in recovering values from waste material routinely. I posted on that subject tonight, a recipe for flux.

Coal ash, also referred to as coal combustion residuals or CCRs, is produced primarily from the burning of coal in coal-fired power plants. Coal ash includes a number of by-products produced from burning coal, including: Fly Ash, a very fine, powdery material composed mostly of silica made from the burning of finely ground coal in a boiler.

Two (2) major techniques for refining gold. Generally, gold can be refined using these two-best-known gold-refining procedures: Aqua Regia and gold electrolysis. Both of these techniques can be used to separate gold from other metals. This is because a little piece of other metals in gold can change its properties and value.
