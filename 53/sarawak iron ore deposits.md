Iron ores, usually rich in iron oxide, are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted. Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined. There are four main types of iron ore deposits worked currently: magnetite, hematite, pisolitic ironstone, and titanomagnetite deposits. Pure iron metal is silvery white in colour

In spite of the deposit's high grade (∼60 percent iron) and huge observable tonnages (1800 Mt) of ore, its remote location, lack of any industrial transport system, and high altitude (c. m) in the Hindu Kush mountains, the deposit at that time many years ago seemed to have little hope of ever being mining anytime soon.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
