Water your cannabis plants with the pH'd water. Remember, you must water until you see runoff draining from the bottom of the pots. The runoff is likely dark in color due to nutrient accumulation. As a rule of thumb, aim for 30-50% drainage from the nutrient solution's total volume.

All of these dams cause the river to back up like a lake, altering the flow regimes of the river. Lacking the flushing attribute of flooding, the river now allows sediment to build up as sand bars, and around stream mouths and dams. This ultimately reduces the river's water bearing capacity and blocks navigation for barges and recreational users.
