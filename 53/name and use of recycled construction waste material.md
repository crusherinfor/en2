As with most waste generated by construction, demolition and renovation projects, ceramic tile disposal is best handled by a temporary roll-off dumpster rental. For smaller jobs like single homes or a standalone office, an 8- or 10-yard dumpster should suffice. For larger jobs, you'll want to consider a 20-, 30- or even 40-yard dumpster.

To battle this, the construction industry can recycle and reuse its plastic waste. This includes plasterboard (or drywall), which is found in walls and floors. As walls are an integral part of any building, the construction industry produces a surplus of plasterboard. One of the best ways to dispose of this is single stream recycling.
