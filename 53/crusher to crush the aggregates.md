## What is the difference between "Crushed Stone" and "Crushed Gravel 
On the other hand, "gravel" is rock fragments sourced from an existing deposit of weathered rock, often from rivers and streams, but also gravel pits. As such, gravel tends to be more rounded in shape. The modifier crushed specifies two things at once. First, that the aggregate be angular in shape and not rounded.

## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.

Miners rely on several types of equipment to process minerals, but the crusher is considered one of the most important. For small mining operations, it may be more affordable to work with a crushing plant for their aggregate needs. It all depends on how often a miner will need to crush minerals and the transportation requirements for the minerals.
