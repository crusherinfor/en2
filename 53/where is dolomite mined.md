## dolomite | Formation, Structure, Properties, Uses, & Facts
dolomite, type of limestone, the carbonate fraction of which is dominated by the mineral dolomite, calcium magnesium carbonate [CaMg(CO3)2]. Along with calcite and aragonite, dolomite makes up approximately 2 percent of the Earth's crust. The bulk of the dolomite constitutes dolostone formations that occur as thick units of great areal extent in many sequences of chiefly marine strata.
