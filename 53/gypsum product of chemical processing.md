## Gypsum - Chemical Formula, Properties, Types, Uses and FAQ - VEDANTU
The main components of gypsum are calcium sulfate (CaSO4) and water (H2O). Its chemical name is Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate and the chemical formula of gypsum is represented as CaSO4.2H2O. Gypsum and Anhydrite (CaSO4) are very similar chemically just that gypsum has 2 water molecules and Anhydrite does not contain any water molecules.

## Synthetic Gypsum | BuildingGreen
Synthetic gypsum, which is now used in about 30% of drywall, is a byproduct of coal-fired power plants. It is sometimes confused with fly ash—another coal combustion product that's been in the news recently—but the two have very little in common. Synthetic gypsum is also called flue-gas-desulfurization (FGD) gypsum.
