## Lithium Mining - JXSC Mining
Lithium Mining What is Lithium. Lithium is an element valuable for the production of glass, aluminum products, and batteries. It is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl(Si2O5)2, lepidolite K(Li,Al)3(Al,Si,Rb)4O10(F,OH)2, spodumene LiAl(SiO3)2 and also subsurface brines. Australia and Chile are the world's largest producers of lithium. Lithium Mining

By. Terence Bell. Updated on August 21, 2020. Most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium-containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium-containing rock, such as spodumene. Lithium production from clay sources is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022.
