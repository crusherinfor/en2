## Iron Record: Ancient Rocks Tell the Story of Oxygen, and Life
Rocks older than 2.3 billion years have low ratios of heavy to light iron isotopes, suggesting that there was little oxygen and a lot of iron in the water. In the second stage, between 2.3 and 1.8 billion years ago, the ratio increased, suggesting that while the atmosphere gained oxygen, the oceans remained mostly oxygen-free.
