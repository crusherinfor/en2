## Gravel vs. Limestone | Hunker
Both gravel and crushed limestone are often sold based on size. Sizing is classified as screenings, pea stones and stones . Screenings start from what's virtually sand through to 3/16 of an inch in diameter. Pea stones are what we would also consider pebbles, from 3/16 to 1/2-inch in diameter. Finally, "stones" are 1/2-inch through to 4 inches

## What You Need to Know Before Adding Limestone to Your Gravel Road 
Limestone displays two crucial characteristics: it is harder than most types of gravel, and its unique binding properties, which set it apart from other types of stone, contribute to a stronger road surface. The Wisconsin State Journal reports that when cars drive on limestone, the chunks of rock rub together to produce a fine dust.

## Crushed Limestone | Driveway Stone & Walkway Stone | Ozinga
Crushed limestone is an aggregate composed of calcium carbonate. Once mined, the stone is crushed to specific sizes where it can be used in a variety of applications such as building materials, drainage, concrete, backfill, and road bases. If you've dealt with limestone in the past, you've likely noticed that there are different grades (sizes).

## Limestone Vs. Crushed Concrete | eHow
Limestone vs. Crushed Concrete. In its pure form, limestone differs significantly from crushed concrete in that the former constitutes a naturally formed rock found in marine environments and the other a manmade construction material. Limestone may appear in crushed concrete as a material found in the cement used to mix concrete.
