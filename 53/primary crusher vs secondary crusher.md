## What Is Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Crushing?
Secondary crushing, as you can imagine, is the second stage of material processing following its initial reduction. At this stage, material will flow through perhaps a second impactor crusher or even a cone crusher, which is effective at breaking down these types of material. There are also tertiary and even quaternary stages of crushing that

## primary and secondary crusher
Cone crushers resemble gyratory crushers from technological standpoint, but unlike gyratory crushers, cone crushers are popular in secondary, tertiary, and quaternary crushing stages. Sometimes, however, the grain size of the processed material is small enough by nature and the traditional primary crushing stage is not needed.

The impact crusher and cone crusher are generally used in medium crushing stage. For example, if the feed size of the material is less than 50mm, you can directly choose the secondary crusher. The fine crusher usually follows the primary crushing or the second crushing, and its output particle size is between 0-10mm.
