## Ghana Production Of Crushed Sand And Aggregate
CRUSHED CONCRETE AS COARSE AGGREGATES IN PRODUCTION. Aggregates can be classified into two classes of coarse aggregate and fine aggregate sand. Classification is based on the aggregate size where the size of the aggregate Gross is more than 5.0 mm while the size of the fine aggregate shall not exceed 5.0 mm. in concrete mixture, the quantity of both is different classes of aggregate based on
