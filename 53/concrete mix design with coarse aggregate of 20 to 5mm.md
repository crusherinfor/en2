For dense concrete it is essential that the coarse and fine aggregates be well graded, giving the maximum packing density.

This allows the use of locally available materials such as coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, etc. 5.Desired Properties of Mix: Concrete obtained through mix design has desired properties such as working capacity, durability, setting time, strength, etc. Disadvantages of Concrete Mix Design: It requires a high initial cost. Also, require

## New Mix Design Method for Recycled Concrete Using Mixed Source Concrete 
Abstract This study proposes a new mix design method for C30 recycled concrete using recycled aggregate crushed from different strength source concrete (SC). The dosages of cement, water, sand, and coarse recycled concrete aggregate (CRCA) are the same as the corresponding components in natural concrete, but the CRCA should be pre-wetted before casting. Its weighted mean strength has a value
