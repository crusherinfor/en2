The iron ore that is blasted is stacked and loaded upon large dumpers to be moved to the blast furnaces for smelting process. Benches are made for the process of iron ore mining. Mechanized mining involves creation of benches that are used for the purpose of drilling, blasting, and finally the transportation of the iron ore to the crushing plant.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth?
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however, because iron does not occur naturally, it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

## How Is Iron Ore Mined - Realonomics
What is iron mining? Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. Where is most iron ore mined?

## How Do You Mine Iron - Realonomics
How is iron extracted from the earth? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.
