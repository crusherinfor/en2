##  Loading & Lashing Cargo - Maritime Safety Innovation Lab
Lashing in general: All cargo must be secured by using materials, which are suitable for the size, construction and weight of the load. Web lashings require edge protection on sharp edges. We recommend not mixing different lashing materials like wires and web lashing on the same cargo, at least for securing in the same lashing direction.

To check if transverse lashings are adequate: The sum of the frictional force due to weight and the athwartship tensional forces offered by the athwartship component of lashing ropes should be more than the transverse external forces.. Thus, (68 × 9.81 × 0.3) + (68.8 + 55.6 + 55.6 + 62.4) = 443, which is more than 312kN.
