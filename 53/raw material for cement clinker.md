## Cement Manufacturing Process | Phases | Flow Chart | Cement
Cement Manufacturing Process Phase 1: Raw Material Extraction. Cement uses raw materials that cover calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. Such raw materials are limestone, clay and sand. Limestone is for calcium. It is combined with much smaller proportions of sand and clay. Sand & clay fulfill the need of silicon, iron and aluminum.

## Cement industry suffering international price increase
The raise of raw material prices during the last 12 months has been a big challenge for the cement industry. Indeed, clinker price (Clinker + Freight) increased by 55% during the first half of 2021 and will even reach 98% soon. (Illustration 2) Consequently, despite the efforts to contain this raw materials crisis, the cement price has

## Raw materials - Understanding Cement
Technically, a cement producer can have almost complete control over clinker composition by blending raw materials of different compositions to produce the desired result. In practice, however, clinker composition is largely determined by the compositions of the locally-available raw materials which make up the bulk of the raw meal.

In the most general sense, portland cement is produced by heating sources of lime, iron, silica, and alumina to clinkering temperature (2,500 to 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit) in a rotating kiln, then grinding the clinker to a fine powder. The heating that occurs in the kiln transforms the raw materials into new chemical compounds.

Grinding coefficient: Rotary kiln clinker: 1.00: Shaft furnace clinker: 1.15-1.25: Granulated blast-furnace slag: 0.55-1.10: Chalk: 3.70: Clay: 3.00-3.50

## Power plant ashes as substitute raw materials - Global Cement
Clinker: Fly ash from coal-fired power plants can be used effectively as a component of raw kiln feed for the manufacture of cement clinker. Fly ash contains significant amounts of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 and has thus been used as a partial replacement of natural raw materials like clay and/or shale in the raw kiln feed.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.
