Almost all Asian ancient cultures claim that wind chimes are their invention. It is hard to tell who is right because this instrument was invented many centuries ago. By 1100 BC, the Chinese cast bells, making the wind bell they named feng-ling. Faith artifacts that could draw kind spirits and scare out bad ones were called wind chimes.
