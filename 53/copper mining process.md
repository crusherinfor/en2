Lithium mining carries high environmental costs.. The IMF is forecasting GDP growth for 2021 to be in the 5.4% range. This bodes well for amplified capital expenditures in 2021 and Industrial Info is expecting at least a 10% to 15% increase based on what we are hearing from mining firms. As a safe haven investment, gold reached a historic high

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

Typical Copper Extraction Process. The process of extracting copper for its ore is quite complex and varied. It largely depends on the type of ore in question, particularly whether it is a sulfide or oxide type. Copper mining has typically been performed through open-pit mining, where stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the ground
