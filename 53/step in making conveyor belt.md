A belt conveyor system uses pulleys or drums to keep an endless loop of conveying belts in continuous motion. Considerations for choosing a suitable belt conveying system include the physical form of the product, processing requirements, and the desired speed and volume of transportation. Belt conveying systems find numerous applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries
