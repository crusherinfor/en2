About Iron Ore Pelletizing (Balling) Pellets are a high-grade source of iron ore and are produced via a type of agitation agglomeration (wet granulation or tumble-growth agglomeration) known as pelletizing, and referred to in the iron ore sector as "balling.". The balling process is carried out utilizing either a rotary drum or disc

## Cogeneration process for production of energy and iron materials
A process and arrangement are provided for the efficient generation of energy from coal, while at the same time providing for a relatively inexpensive step in processing of iron or steel, and the extraction of valuable materials such as oils from coal.An advantage to the process is that relatively low quality coals can be utilized, since the coal is pretreated before any burning operation.
