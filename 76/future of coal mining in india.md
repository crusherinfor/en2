## Future of coal in India: Smooth transition or bumpy road ahead?
Oct 29, 2020While India imposes a Rs. 400/tonne (metric ton) cess upon coal, which even applies to imports, this is only about $5.5 per short ton of coal. If one were to convert this to an implicit carbon tax, it is only a little over $3/ton CO2. Imposing a high carbon tax will be difficult, especially given the implications on the price of electricity
