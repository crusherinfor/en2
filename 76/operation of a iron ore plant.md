##  Iron Ore Pelletization Technology and its Environmental Impact 
The eastern region itself accounts for the 55% of the total Iron ore of our country. The share of lumps in total iron ore production has been about 40 % with the rest being accounted for fines and concentrates. Iron Ore Fines/blue dust cannot be charged in the blast furnace directly since they block the passage for ascending gas inside the feed.
