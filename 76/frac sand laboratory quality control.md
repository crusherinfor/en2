This size sand is ideal for fracking, and other uses. Our Brady Brown sand is 99% quartz, and less than .02% iron oxide, making it ideal for oil and gas wells for fracking and many, many other uses. Our 20Ã—40 mesh level sand, like all of our sand, maintains it's round to sub-round shape, meaning it is perfect for draining and removing.

## Frac Sand Mining - Earthworks
Frac Sand Mining. Hydraulic fracturing uses high pressure water to break open underground geologic formations - most commonly shale. - containing oil and gas. Once the shale is fractured, if the fractures are not propped open, they will close again. So frackers use frack sand to prop open the fractures to allow the oil and gas to be extracted.
