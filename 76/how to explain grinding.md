## Three factors affecting the surface roughness of grinding machine 
1.Factors related to grinding wheel affecting the surface roughness of grinding. Mainly the grain size, hardness and the dressing of the grinding wheel. The finer the grain size of the grinding wheel, the more abrasive grains per unit area of the grinding wheel, the finer the scratch on the grinding surface, and the smaller the surface

## What is Dressing and Why Does Your Grinding Wheel Need It? - Okuma
Dressing returns the grinding wheel to its original sharpness by removing old grains to reveal the fresh grain underneath. It removes clogs, dulled abrasive grains, and excess bonding material to help minimize vibration, thereby improving surface finish. Dressing also helps restore the shape of the wheel which changes over time due to wheel

## Centerless grinding
Centerless grinding is a machining process that uses abrasive cutting to remove material from a workpiece. Centerless grinding differs from centered grinding operations in that no spindle or fixture is used to locate and secure the workpiece; the workpiece is secured between two rotary grinding wheels, and the speed of their rotation relative to each other determines the rate at which material

No need to worry about the geology of this. What is important is that these rocks are both hard and have pores. You need hard so bits don't come off too easily when you are grinding. You need pores because as you grind down the surface stays uneven, meaning you don't have to have the metate picada (pecked) to restore an uneven surface so often.

## Difference Between Machining and Grinding
Grinding. Machining is one bulk material removal process (i.e. high MRR). Thus it is economical and suitable to give proper size and also for semi-finishing. Grinding has low material removal rate and is preferred only for finishing. Accuracy and tolerance achieved by conventional machining operations are not so good.
