## Process for removal of sulfur and ash from coal - MyScienceWor
The sulfur and ash content of coal particles is reduced by treating the coal particles in an aqueous slurry with a minor amount of hydrocarbon oil to form coal-oil aggregates, incorporating a gas into or on the aggregates to modify their apparent density and then separating the aggregates from ash and mineral matter in the slurry by gravitational means.

## What Steps Have Power Plants Taken To Reduce The Amount Of Sulfur 
One option is to use coal that contains less sulfur. Another option is to "wash" the coal to remove some of the sulfur. The power plant can also install equipment called scrubbers which remove the sulfur dioxide from gases leaving the smokestack. What are the 3 ways to reduce sulfur dioxide?
