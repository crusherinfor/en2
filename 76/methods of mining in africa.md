Prospectors established in 1886 the existence of a belt of gold-bearing reefs 40 miles (60 km) wide centred on present-day Johannesburg. The rapid growth of the gold-mining industry intensified processes started by the diamond boom: immigration, urbanization, capital investment, and labour migrancy. By 1899 the gold industry attracted investment worth £75 million, produced almost three-tenths

## The future of mining in South Africa - Mining Technology
The South African mining industry has consistently increased the size of its workforce, from 406,994 in 2001 to 453,543 in 2018. This has led to a parallel increase in the tax paid by mining companies to the national government, from $1.21bn in 2010 to $1.56bn in 2018, according to the country's Minerals Council.

## Mining all of the reef, all of the time
South Africa's reef deposits, especially gold and platinum-bearing ore bodies, are narrow and tabular. While legislation dictates a minimum operation height of 800 mm in areas where people work, some of the country's narrow reef mines have ore bodies with thicknesses of less than 500 mm, which results in ore dilution, as waste ore with zero economic value is also mined.

## The History of Mining in Africa - African Mining & Minerals
Oct 5, 2020An evolving mining sector: historic enabler of progress in Africa. Africa has long exploited its mineral resources. In fact, the oldest mines in the world are to be found in Africa such as the Ingwenya mine in Swaziland, which was exploited 20,000 years ago for iron ores for rock paintings. In addition, there are thousands of ancient gold and

## Harvesting mineral riches: 1000 years of gold mining in Ghana
The region's first gold mining companies were formed shortly after the British established the Gold Coast Colony in 1874, and, following two successive gold rushes in the early-1900s, gold prospecting and extraction were widespread in Obuasi, Tarkwa and Prestea. However, the industry soon entered a period of depressed production, which began

Open-pit mining. Some 53% of South Africa's coal is produced from surface mining, via open-cast or open-pit mines. This is because the coal is less than 60 metres below the surface. Open-pit mines use draglines, as well as truck and shovel operations to extract coal. A dragline excavator uses a dragline to pull a bucket by a wire cable.
