## Review of Stone Dust Application in Queensland Underground Coal Mines
Stone dust application prevents coal dust explosions in underground coal mines. It does this by stopping oxidative reactions from taking place. The most commonly used form of stone dust is limestone. Coal dust explosions occur as a result of self-heating or spontaneous combustion. In underground coal mines coal dust explosions are a long

Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam, which drives a turbine, which produces electricity. In 2019, about 23 percent of all electricity in the United States was
