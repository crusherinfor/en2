## Unlocking millions of tonnes of nickel - CSIRO
Traditional nickel laterite processing techniques use large quantities of sulphuric acid at high temperatures and pressures, resulting in expensive waste treatment and disposal of the chemicals used in the extraction process. Nickel laterites are becoming a priority for mining companies as traditional nickel sulphide reserves are depleted.

A basic principle of copper-sulfide nickel ore process is that it is better to let copper assimilate into nickel ore rather than the opposite. For it is easier to recovery cooper from nickel concentrate.

The nickel and cobalt metallurgy processes begin with an initial treatment of the mineral, re-concentrating it through crushing and flotation/gravity and obtaining a "speiss", rich in cobalt and nickel. The process begins by adding the sulfide-associated mineral to a reactor with sulfuric acid and pressurised air.

## how nickel mining process
After mining, nickel ores are further processed to upgrade their nickel contents from 1-4% typical of the ores to concentrates with grades in the range 10-20%. Concentration involves crushing the ore and separating nickel-bearing from other minerals using various physical and chemical processing methods.
