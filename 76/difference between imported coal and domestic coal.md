Coal produces much heat than charcoal, which makes it be preferred for heating industrial systems and in steam generation for electricity production. On the other hand, the heat produced by charcoal is just enough to be used for domestic purposes. Large amounts of charcoal are required to create the same temperature as realized by coal.

## What is the difference between thermal coal and steam coal?
The classification of coal is generally based on the content of volatiles. However the most important distinction is between thermal coal (also known as steam coal), which is burnt to generate electricity via steam; and metallurgical coal (also known as coking coal), which is burnt at high temperature to make steel.

Main Differences Between Coal Energy and Nuclear Energy. Coal must be mined and transported, which can be costly and can even cause pollution and harm to the environment and workers. Nuclear power doesn't have to be mined, and it's clean and safe. Coal energy is an electric energy that is produced by burning coal.
