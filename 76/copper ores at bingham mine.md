## What Is Copper Ore - Realonomics
The principal copper ore mineral is chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) which is commonly smelted to yield a matte containing ~50% copper. What is copper ore used for? Most copper mined today is used to conduct electricity - mostly as wiring. It is also an excellent conductor of heat and is used in cooking utensils heat sinks and heat exchangers.

Specifically, we assess changes in smelting and mining methods during the late 19th and 20th centuries on the temporal atmospheric deposition of lead, arsenic, and selenium, which are known to have been lost in great quantities (Schneider et al., 2019), along with copper, which is known to be enriched in the local mining ores (Blainey, 1993).

## Kennecott's Bingham Canyon Mine Visitor Center
Founded in 1903, Kennecott's Bingham Canyon Mine is one of the largest man-made open-pit excavations in the world. The operation is so immense, it can be seen from space. The mine operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. With over 20 million tons of refined copper ore produced in the past 116 years, it's one of the top performing mines in
