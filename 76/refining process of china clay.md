## Refining process
The CharFuel Â® Coal Refining Process yields coproducts similar to crude oil refining, including gasoline, Jet-A fuel, green diesel, and heating oil, as well as petrochemicals such as benzene, toluene, and xylene at costs less than that of comprable petroleum products. Uses existing pipelines, tankers, and trains with no modification.

## Lithium Refining for Clay Li Producers - Mangrove Lithium
Historically, unlocking lithium clay as a feedstock has been time and capital intensive. Although abundant, Li clay deposits are heavily diluted by additional minerals, resulting in a low concentration of Li for conversion. Mangrove boosts project viability by optimizing the refining process of lithium sulfate from clay to lithium hydroxide.

During palm oil refining process, we need to de-acid, mainly dedicated to remove the free fatty acid of the degummed palm oil. We adopt alkali refining method in palm oil refining process, that's to use NaOH or other alkali to neutralize the free fattyacid of the oil, let producing soapstock separated from oil.

## Types of Clay for Pottery - The 5 Main Types of Ceramic Clay
Part of the production process involves refining and blending the ingredients of the clay. As already stated, there are lots of different types of stoneware. However, broadly speaking stoneware is a mixture of feldspar, quartz, and ball clay.  However, kaolin is a very pure kind of white clay also known as china clay. Kaolin is actually used

## Comparison of BERC re-refining process with acid/clay/distillation 
Abstract. This report compares the economics of acid/clay re-refining with the economics of the BERC solvent re-refining process. The costs of re-refining using the BERC process have been studied in a previous report entitled ''Predesign Cost Estimate for Re-refined Lube Oil Plant'' prepared for the Bartlesville Energy Research Center.
