## Review on Beneficiation Techniques and Reagents Used for Phosphate Ores
Phosphate ore is an important raw material for manufacturing fertilizers and phosphorous chemical products. While most of the phosphate resources cannot be directly treated as feed stock due to the low grade of P2O5 and high content of impurities. In order to obtain a qualified phosphate concentrate, the beneficiation of the low-grade phosphate ore is, hence, of great necessity.

## Phosphate Beneficiation | ArrMaz
Mined phosphate is sold to processing plants that digest the rock using sulfuric acid to make phosphoric acid. The vast majority of phosphoric acid is used in the production of fertilizers to grow the food the world needs, but phosphoric acid is also used as an additive in livestock feed and even in food products.

By Dr. Fathi Habashi. Figure 1—Typical phosphate losses in Florida. Great effort is spent by the phosphate industry to beneficiate the rock to obtain a concentrate containing 30%-31% P 2 O 5 . [1] During this process, much of the phosphate values are lost to the tailings stream. For example, to obtain 1 ton of rock containing 31% P 2 O 5

## Beneficiation of Akashat Phosphate Rocks by Flotation Process
Phosphate beneficiation is carried out at the phosphate beneficiation Plant at Al-Qaim Fertilizer Complex to raise the content of P 2 O 5 from 19-20 % to about 30% through the calcination process.
