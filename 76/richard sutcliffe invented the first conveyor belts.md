The next major innovation was the underground conveyor belt, which mining engineer Richard Sutcliffe invented and patented in 1905. While conveyor belts already had applications in the mining industry, they weren't yet used underground. They needed some adaptations to survive the harsh environments and operate in confined spaces.

## Richard Sutcliffe - Inventor and Mining Son of Slieveardagh
Richard Sutcliffe (1849 - 1930) was a native of the Slieveardagh hills and for a short time he was owner of a coal mine at The Commons, Thurles. Richard later went on to become a well renowned engineer and inventor of coal mining equipment. He invented the world's first underground belt conveyor, which revolutionized coal extraction and eased the laborious and dangerous work of mining.

The first steel conveyor belts were introduced by Sandvik in 1901, and an innovative Turnover Conveyor Belt System was invented and patented in 1957 by the B.F. Goodrich Company. Conveyors can be made from many different materials, and belts often have three layers. steel conveyor belts are often chosen when a high strength class is needed.
