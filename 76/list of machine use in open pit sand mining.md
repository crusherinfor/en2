## Surface mining - strip, open pit, mountaintop removal, dredging
Surface Mining. Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed. It is the other way of underground mining, in which the overlying rock is left behind, and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels. Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of

## Sand Pit - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
During mining, Quaternary sand was exploited from a pit and used as stowing sand, mainly for the nearby Katowice Coal Mine. This mine was in operation from 1823 to 1999 and closed due to natural-resource utilization issues in Poland. After the mine closed, the exploited sand pit was filled with communal refuse. Later, coal waste from different

Surface mining is defined as the extraction of ore from an open pit or burrow. Surface mining is sometimes known as open-pit, open-cut or open-cast mining and is only commercially viable if the deposit is located relative close to the surface. Less than 20% of Alberta's bitumen reserves are close enough to the surface to be mined.

Sand mining is the extraction of sand, mainly through an open pit (or sand pit) but sometimes mined from beaches and inland dunes or dredged from ocean and river beds. Sand is often used in manufacturing, for example as an abrasive or in concrete.It is also used on icy and snowy roads usually mixed with salt, to lower the melting point temperature, on the road surface.

Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.It is applied to ore or rocks found at the surface because the overburden is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunnelling (as would be the case for sand cinder and gravel).

1.What is open pit mining？ Open pit mining is the process of removing the covering from the ore body to obtain the desired minerals. Open-pit mining can be divided into open-pit metal deposit mining, open-pit coal mining, and open-pit iron mining.The former mainly mines non-ferrous metals, the middle mainly mines coal and some non-metallic ores, and the latter mainly mines iron ore.

Openpit mining uses large holes in the ground that are excavated to the depth of the desired product and are common for sand gravel and copper mines. Mining machines called draglines use a moving bucket to scrape away the soil lying over the ore deposit. Draglines can move the soil to a waste pile away from the pit or dump the material into large trucks that transport it away from the site.

In particular, surface mining is used to retrieve sand, gravel, stones, coal, iron and other metals. There are five recognized types of surface mining, each with specific variations depending on the minerals being extracted. These include strip mining, open-pit mining, mountaintop removal, dredging and highwall mining.
