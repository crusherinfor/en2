## Coal Washing | Encyclopedia
Coal washing Coal that comes from a mine is a complex mixture of materials with a large variety of physical properties. In addition to the coal itself, pieces of rock, sand, and various minerals are contained in the mixture. Thus, before coal can be sold to consumers, it must be cleaned. The cleaning process consists of a number of steps that results in a product that is specifically suited to

After coal extraction, the topsoil is replaced so that the area can be reused for croplands, wildlife habitats, recreation or offices. Underground mining is another method of coal extraction that involves extracting coal that is buried several hundred feet below the surface.
