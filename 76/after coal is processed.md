## Coal Washing | Encyclopedia
Coal washing Coal that comes from a mine is a complex mixture of materials with a large variety of physical properties. In addition to the coal itself, pieces of rock, sand, and various minerals are contained in the mixture. Thus, before coal can be sold to consumers, it must be cleaned. The cleaning process consists of a number of steps that results in a product that is specifically suited to
