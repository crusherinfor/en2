## Study on Failure Characteristics of Stemming Structure on Iron Ore 
Blasting tests on iron ore specimens with different stemming structures were carried out to quantify the internal fracture and damage characteristics of the specimens by means of computed tomography (CT) scanning, digital image processing and three-dimensional (3D) model reconstruction techniques. The results showed that the blasting load produced radial and circumferential cracks in the iron

## Limonite: an iron oxide used as pigment and iron ore - Geology
Limonite has been used as a low-quality iron ore for thousands of years. Commercial mining of limonite as a source of iron is no longer done in areas where reasonable deposits of hematite and magnetite are present or readily imported. Limonite deposits are usually too small and too impure for use in modern metallurgy.

## how is iron ore used in pigments
Earthy iron ore used as a pigment.Jun 05, 2022 Â· An oxide of iron, Venetian red, is used as a pigment in the paint for bridges and railroad cars and in rouge for cosmetics and for polishing lenses. Laundry bluing and the blueprints used by architects and engineers contain the pigment called Prussian blue, which is an ironpound.
