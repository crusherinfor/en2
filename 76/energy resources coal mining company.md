## Coal, Climate Justice, and the Cultural Politics of Energy Transition 
Abstract. In the wake of the Paris Agreement on climate change, promises to phase out coal-fired power have suggested cause for optimism around energy transition globally. However, coal remains entangled with contentious development agendas in many parts of the world, while fossil fuel industries continue to flourish. This article discusses these entanglements through a climate justice lens

Coal is a black or brownish-black sedimentary rock that can be burned for fuel and used to generate electricity.It is composed mostly of carbon and hydrocarbons, which contain energy that can be released through combustion (burning). Coal is the largest source of energy for generating electricity in the world, and the most abundant fossil fuel in the United States.

The mining industry is responsible for 4%-7% of global greenhouse gas emissions - 1% of these are from Scope 1 and 2 emissions, caused directly by mining operations or indirectly through, for example, electricity consumption used to power mines; the remaining 3%-6% coming from fugitive methane emissions.

3 days agoCardinal News. If we want renewable energy, we need to mine more coal. That seems counterintuitive, but chemistry is complicated. Last month, an Australia-based company, Coronado Global Resources, announced it will invest $169 million to expand its coal operations in Buchanan and Tazewell counties - adding 181 jobs to the 585 already there.

Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.
