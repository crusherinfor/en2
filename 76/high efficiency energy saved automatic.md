Chillers. There are two types of high-efficiency chillers for HVAC systems: air-cooled chillers and water-cooled chillers. A chiller's efficiency is measured by the coefficient of performance (COP), which is the ratio of heating or cooling provided to electrical energy consumed. Higher COPs indicate greater efficiency.
