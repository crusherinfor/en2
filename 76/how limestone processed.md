## Limestone: Rock Uses, Formation, Composition, Pictures - Geology
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.

Mar 4, 2022Underground limestone caves form through the natural chemical weathering process described above. Most caves form in karst, a landscape composed of limestone, gypsum, and dolomite rocks that dissolve gradually in slightly acidic water.. The water eats away the bedrock, forming underground passages that take as many as 100,000 years to become large enough for human entry.
