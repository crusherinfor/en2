The investment casting method, also called the lost wax process, is used for precision casting of aerospace components such as gas turbine blades. The investment casting of aluminium alloys results in lower strength than sand castings, but offers tighter tolerances, better surface finish and the capability to produce thin-walled sections.

## Investment Casting - Everything You Need to know About It
Jan 24, 2022Investment casting is a centuries-old casting technique based on lost-wax casting. The procedure is known this way because the mold pattern used in this casting process is "invested" with liquid material. During the investment casting process, investment materials are used to create a mold into which liquid metal can be poured.

## Set the temperature of cooling water 10~20℃ lower than the mold 
Set the temperature of cooling water 10~20℃ lower than the mold temperature. If the mold temperature is 40~50℃ or above, need to consider to add the insulation plate between the mould and mold platens of injection molding machine. In order to improve the surface quality of the product, sometimes need high mold temperature.
