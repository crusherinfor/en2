## Lightweight Aggregates | Aggregate Industries
Lightweight aggregates. Our lightweight aggregates from Lytag® are made from fly ash generated by coal fired power stations. Our technology heats the fly ash to 1,100°C to create a hard pellet, with a honeycombed internal structure. Which can then be used as a superior, lightweight aggregate which is up to 50 lighter than natural aggregate.

In most light weight aggregates as the size of aggregate increases the strength and bulk density of the aggregate decrease. Using very big size light weight aggregate with a lower strength results in a lower strength of the light weight concrete; therefore, biggest size of the light weight aggregate must be limited to 25 mm at most. 3.
