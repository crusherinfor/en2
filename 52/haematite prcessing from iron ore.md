The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron. Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel. Steel is used to make automobiles, locomotives, ships, beams used in buildings, furniture, paper clips, tools, reinforcing rods for concrete, bicycles, and thousands of other items. It is the most-used metal by both tonnage and purpose.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

Magnetite ore's most distinctive property is its magnetism. It is the most magnetic mineral in the world. Additionally, obtaining iron from hematite ore can produce a great deal of carbon emissions, and the process for magnetite is much less harmful. The product from magnetite ore is also of higher quality than from hematite ore.

## How Is Iron Ore Extracted - Realonomics
How Is Iron Ore Extracted? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

With the depleting reserves of high-grade iron ore in the world, froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate- and low-grade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly growing demand on the international market. In over half a century's practice in the iron ore industry, froth flotation has been established as an efficient method to remove impurities from iron ore.

This study investigates upgrading of low-grade banded hematite quartzite iron ore (Fe ~31%). Conventional beneficiation was found to be futile. The susceptibility of iron phases to microwave exposure and their selective absorption assists in the liberation of iron values. Microwave exposure of coarse particles at 540 W for 10 min yielded a concentrate with Fe 56.30% and recovery of 50.68%
