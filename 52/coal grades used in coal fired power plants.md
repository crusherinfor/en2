## coal grades used in coal fired power plants
May 04, 2011· Y. Yan, in Advanced Power Plant Materials, Design and Technology, 2010 10.1 Introduction. Coal-fired power stations are burning an increasingly varied range of fuels and fuel blends, including sub-bituminous and lower volatile coals and biomass of varying composition and combustion properties, under tight economic and environmental constraints.

## Moving the Coal Through a Coal-Fired Power Plant - Advancing Mining
Every year 1.1 billion tons of coal are burned in the U.S., with 90% of that being used for electricity generation. Several years ago, a University of Illinois professor reported that to produce 109 kWh/year of power, a plant burns 14,000 tons of coal every day. He noted that the coal that goes to a typical coal-fired power plant is crushed to approximately 5 cm in size before it is loaded

A coal-fired power plant emits roughly twice the amount of carbon dioxide for the energy produced as a natural gas-fired power plant. Burning coal releases 2,249 lbs of carbon dioxide, 13 lbs of SO 2 and 6 lbs of NO x per MWh. Coal fired power plants are responsible for 18 % of the total nitrogen oxides released by people in the US.

The topic of coal fired power plants used to be simple. Thanks to fracking, natural gas prices are now approaching coal prices.  High grade coal has an energy density of about 32MJ/kg (For our math, lets assume the best coal is used everywhere. In reality it is about 24, so my world with coal is 33% nicer than the real world).

## Carbon Dioxide Emission Factors for Coal
The high carbon dioxide emission factor for anthracite reflects the coal's relatively small hydrogen content, which lowers its heating value. (11) In pounds of carbon dioxide per million Btu, U.S. average factors are 227.4 for anthracite, 216.3 for lignite, 211.9 for subbituminous coal, and 205.3 for bituminous coal. Table FE4.
