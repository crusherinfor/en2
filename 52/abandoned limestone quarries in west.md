## 44. Hjerm Limestone Quarry | GeoparkVestjylland
The limestone is at the surface here because an underlying salt dome has elevated the Danian limestone by about 400 m (see also site 24 - Odby Klint, site 43 - Bjørndal Limestone Quarry and G25 - Sevel Limestone Quarry). This salt dome is known as the Vejrum salt structure (Figure 44-1 and 44-2).

## Old Limestone Quarry - Land And Farm
Old Limestone Quarry closed in early 1960s is now mostly hardwood forest. The railroad and buildings are gone but the extensive tunnels are still there and mother nature has taken over the surface with a diverse forest. No restrictions, frontage on 3 county roads just at the edge of the small town limits with utilities available.
