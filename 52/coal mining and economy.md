Coal Mining Coal accounts for half of the electricity production in the United States. In recent decades, the Clean Air Act has accelerated a major shift in coal production from eastern mines to large western surface mines. Nevertheless, 78% of all mining jobs are east of the Mississippi River, and 57% are in underground mines.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

The various methods of mining a coal seam can be classified under two headings, surface mining and underground mining. Surface and underground coal mining are broad activities that incorporate numerous variations in equipment and methods, and the choice of which method to use in extracting a coal seam depends on many technological, economic, and social factors.

## Environmental and socio-economic impacts of coal mining
Jan 21, 2022Coal mining activities directly impact geo-environmental parameters such as air, water, soil, agricultural lands, flora, LULC, and landforms. The people who live near mining zones are the ones that suffer the most. Quantifying the impacts, determining the causes, and recommending appropriate remedial measures are necessary for mining areas.
