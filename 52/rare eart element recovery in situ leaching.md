## Microbial communities in rare earth mining soil after in-situ leaching 
Results showed that in-situ leaching mining considerably impacted microbial communities of the mining soils. The abundances of bacterial, archaeal, and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were significantly and negatively correlated with ionic rare earth elements (REEs), while their diversities were relatively stable.
