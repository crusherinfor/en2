## Field Tests on Soil to Determine Suitability of Soil for Brick 
Ball test is mainly for getting a first feeling about the soils sand and clay proportion. Take a handful of soil and put some water in it. Water should be enough to make the soil moist and make dough by hand. With the hand and fingers mix the soil and water thoroughly. After uniform mixing try to make a ball out of the soil.

5. Firing the Bricks . Firing the Bricks. The final step in the brick making process was "cooking" the bricks in a kiln. The bricks had to be cooked to a high enough temperature to be "cured." Thousands of dry, raw bricks were stacked over a fire, and walls were built on all sides of the fire, to contain the high heat.

Ball Mills. In ceramics, ball mills are used to grind down materials into very fine particles. Materials such as clay and glaze components can be broken down in a ball mill by getting placed into rotating or rolling jars with porcelain balls inside them. During milling, the porcelain balls pulverized the materials into an incredibly fine powder.
