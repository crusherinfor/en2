## An exquisite stone of natural beauty, granite is unearthed in huge 
Once the headstone looks clean, wash it off with water to remove soapy residue. To do this, get a couple of liters of clean water and wash the headstone with a clean rag. After that's done, use a clean cloth to dry the headstone as soon as possible. Make sure to clean engravings or inlays with a cotton swab or ball and a little soapy water
