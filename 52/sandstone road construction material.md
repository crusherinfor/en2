## Macadam Road : 4 Types, Construction & Figure - Dream Civil
There are different stages of road development. Among them, Macadam Road is the most successful type. John Loudon Macadam (1756 -1836 AD) was the surveyor-general of the road in England who put forward an entirely new method of road construction called the macadam road. This road was the first road based on scientific thinking.. The importance of subgrade, drainage, and compaction was also

Although gravel road construction can be done anytime on any surface, a smooth, long-lasting roadway requires the right process. Like any other building project, a gravel road starts with the foundation. The other three stages are sub-grade material, sub-base material and gravel surface. Weak areas are potential problems waiting to happen.
