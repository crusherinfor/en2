## Performance-Based Selection of the Cathode Material for the 
In the conventional gold electrowinning that is performed in alkaline cyanide solutions, constantly applied current itself provides a cathodic protection of the electrode materials from corrosion. This allows for the usage of common stainless steels, such as 304 or 316L, as cathode materials in industrial gold electrowinning circuits. [13,14

## Electrowinning
Electrowinning, also called electroextraction, is the electrodeposition of metals from their ores that have been put in solution or liquefied. Electrorefining uses a similar process to remove impurities from a metal. Both processes use electroplating on a large scale and are important techniques for the economical and straightforward purification of non-ferrous metals.

In this case, gold is deposited on cylindrical steel wool cathode, The anode is stainless steel. Steel wool was used in the first electrowinning cells used in gold mining operations, it is a good unit and leaks are not a problem. It is interesting to indicate that as the gold deposition takes place, the available surface area tends to decrease. j

## How Current Density Affect the Cathode Deposit in Copper Electrowinning
In the copper electrowinning process, the copper plating rate increases with increasing current density. However, excessive current density gives rough, nodular cathode deposits and decreased copper purity. Therefore, each plant chooses its current density as a balance between these opposing factors. Maximizing current efficiency.

## Electrowinning - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Nov 17, 2020Electrowinning is defined as the cathodic deposition of metal, in this example copper, from a copper bearing solution by the passage of an electric current current using an insoluble anode. The overall reaction is the combination of two electrochemical half reactions. The amount of copper that is deposited in the reaction is defined as an
