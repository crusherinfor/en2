## What are Coal feeders? Principle, components. | Instrumentation and 
What are coal feeders? Coal Feeder is a device that regulates the amount of coal to be supplied into the Coal Mill. The amount of coal is regulated according to the needs in the boiler combustion chamber (furnace).. The number regulation system in the coal feeder can be done in two ways based on the type, namely by weight fraction or coal volume fraction.

## Vibrating Feeder Design - Stockpile & Reclaim | General Kinematics
Vibratory feeders are basically applied to a control function to meter or control the flow of material from a hopper, bin, or stockpile, much the same as an orifice or valve control flow in a hydraulic system. In a similar sense, feeders can be utilized as fixed rate, such as an orifice, or adjustable rate, as a valve.
