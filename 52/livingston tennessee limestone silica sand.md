## Limestone
Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into low-magnesium and high-magnesium

North Carolina. DanielJameS said: Has anyone else in the Middle TN area had any issues with silica/silicates and ditaoms? Over the last 3-4 years I have struggled with on-going diatoms in my reef tanks and have to assume through process of elimination it's either the sand I've used or the water supply that are feeding it with silica/silicates.

Wollastonite was produced using solid-state reaction from limestone and silica sand. Limestone containing a high percentage of CaO (55.10%) and silica sand with 99% SiO 2 were used as starting materials. The ratios of limestone/sand used were 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 with various firing temperatures, namely 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400 and 1450 °C.The raw materials and fired products were characterised for

Limestone, when heated, gives lime which is used to neutralize acids. Also, lime is used to treat wastewater, animal waste, industrial sludge, and water supplies. Lime is also used to control odor by filtering the water. Lime is used as a chemical agent known as flux. Flux removes phosphorous, sulfur, and silica from the steel, making it purer.
