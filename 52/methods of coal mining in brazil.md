## Mining Methods - SlideShare
2. Mining Methods • Coal is mined by two main methods - surface or 'opencast' mining and 'underground' mining. • The choice of method is largely determined by the depth, geology of the coal deposit and other factors. • The majority of the world's coal production is coming from Opencast mines. • This scenario is same in India also.

## Mining : What is Mining? What are the 4 mining methods?
Four main methods of mining are available: underground, open surface (pit), placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and often used to reach deposits that are deeper. Surface mines are usually used for deposits that are shallower and less valuable. Placer mining is used in river channels, beach sands, or other

## Brazil plans to prop up coal sector, defying calls for a global phase out
It would support the coal sector in Brazil's southern states until 2050. The ministry says the money will be used to modernise and provide incentives to Brazil's coal-fired thermal power plants and could create 600 jobs in mining operations. It added the southern region' coal reserves could supply 18.6 GW of power over 100 years.

## Coal mining methods | Open vs Underground Mining
Coal mining methods can be classified into two broad categories - surface mining and underground mining. The geology of the coal deposit determines what kind of method needs to be used. At the existing rate of production, an estimated figure of 861 billion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide means that there is adequate coal to last us

## 3 Methods of Coal Mining - EzineArticles
1- Contour Mining: Contour Mining is most commonly used in areas that have steep or rolling terrain. It involves digging the earth above the coal line, or coal seam, along the contours of the hilly terrain. This method can be dangerous because it may cause landslides and erosion problems. 2- Strip Mining: Strip Mining usually occurs on flat

## Coal Types, Formation and Methods of Mining
Most underground coal is mined by the room and pillar method, where by rooms are cut into the coal bed leaving a series of pillars, or columns of coal, to help support the mine roof and control the flow of air.Generally, rooms are 2,000 feet wide and the pillars up to 300 feet wide. At least 60 feet of coal was left between an underground mine and the surface, if not the surface had a higher

More specifically, mining is used to extract non-renewable resources like fossil fuels, minerals and even water. There are four main methods of mining: underground, surface, placer and in-situ.

Large scale mechanised mining methods we use include: long-wall mining, where a long wall of coal is mined in a single slice, usually by a large machine. sub-level-caving, where levels of the ore are blasted by explosives; and ; block caving, where large areas of the ore body are blasted and then extracted with the assistance of gravity.

Other underground coal mines are laid out in a checkerboard of rooms and pillars (Fig. 2), and the mining operation involves cyclical, step by-step mining sequences. The rooms are the empty areas from which coal has been mined, and the pillars are blocks of coal (generally 40 to 80 feet on a side) left to support the mine roof.

Coal is widely distributed around the world and the United States has approximately 21 percent of the world's coal resources (EIA, 2014). The coal industry in the United States is mature, tracing its origin to the first commercial exploitation of coal in the Manakin area, near Richmond, Virginia, in 1701. By 1760, most of the colonies knew about the existence of coal fields within their

Nancy Irwin Maxwell, in Encyclopedia of Energy, 2004. 1.1 Environmental Impacts of Underground and Surface Mining of Coal. Coal mining traditionally took place underground, with men and equipment following seams of coal deep within mountains. Since the 1960s, surface mining methods have become more common, and today they account for more than half of the coal produced in the United States.

## Coal Mining -The 2 Most Basic Techniques Of Extraction
They are two most basic methods that miners use to quarry coal. While surface mining is used for coal that can be found anywhere from the surface to 200 feet below, underground mining is used for coal that is located lower. In surface mining, the top layer is removed which may include plants, soil rocks. This exposes the coal below the top layer.

Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.
