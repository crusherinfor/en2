Generally, iron content must be reduced to 0.030% Fe2O3 or less. &. Silica sand for making glass, pottery and ceramics must meet rigid specifications and generally standard washing schemes are inadequate for meeting these requirements.

Silica fume is an ultra-fine, nano-size powder also known as micro-silica. Silica fume is not to be confused with fumed silica. The production process, particle morphology and fields of application of silica fume are all different from those of fumed silica. Silica fume is an amorphous, non-crystalline, polymorph form of SiO2.
