## What is Coal? | Worldatlas
Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining, depending on its depth of location below the land surface. If deposits occur less than 200 feet below the surface of land, surface mining can be put to action to retrieve coal. This method is both time- and labor-saving as well, and in turn economically efficient.
