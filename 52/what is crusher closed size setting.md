A Cone Crusher will deliver a 4:1 to 6:1 reduction ratio. As we set the closed side setting tighter to create a finer output, we also reduce the volume or throughput capacity of the machine. Generally speaking, multiplying the closed side setting by two is a good guide to the top size of the gradation exiting the machine.

The closed side setting determines what the final size of the particles will be and that setting can be adjusted until you've reached the desired material size. Usually, these crushers deliver a 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 reduction ratio. As you reduce the closed side setting to produce smaller material, you also reduce the capacity of the machine.
