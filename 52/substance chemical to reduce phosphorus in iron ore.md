The liquid iron is cast, or poured and hardened, into crude ingots called pigs, and the pigs are subsequently remelted along with scrap and alloying elements in cupola

3.1.3. S and P Contents in Iron Ores. Phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S) are considered to be contaminants in iron ores. More specifically, phosphorus lowers the solidification temperature, increases fluidity, and renders the metal very fluid indirectly through the production of a low melting constituent in iron and steel making [].Moreover, phosphorus increases the cold shortness of steel.

## Phosphorus in Steels - IspatGuru
The composition of the eutectic is 10.2 % P and 89.8 % Fe. In steels, P exists exclusively as a solid solution in ferrite. It is the most potent ferrite strengthener after carbon (C).
