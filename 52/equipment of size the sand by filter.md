## The fundamentals of working with sand filters
Figure 1: A sand filter dissected. As a service professional, this author's favourite type of filter is the sand filter. Of all the other types of filters (e.g. cartridge, diatomaceous earth [DE]), sand filters are efficient with a minimum amount of maintenance, but as with all equipment, there can be issues.For those new to the pool industry, the following is a quick explanation of how sand

Remove the Old Filter Sand. Before you begin working with the filter you will need to turn your pool pump off and disconnect power to the pump at the circuit breaker. Next you will drain the water from the filter. Remove the drain cap or plug on the filter to allow the water to drain. After the water is drained you can begin taking apart the

## Sand vs Cartridge Pool Filters: What's the Difference?
Cartridges have a porous membrane that water can flow through. The fabric is what catches particles and debris. These catch much smaller particles than sand filters do in the 10-15 micron range. The membranes in cartridge filters wear out much faster than sand does, so they have to be replaced every 1-3 years.

Sand filters are filled about 2/3 full with specially graded Pool Filter Sand, or, and a pump that s too big can damage filter media when flow rates exceed the filter design flow rate The size of your filter will also greatly affect the filter media lifespan If your filter is double the size, the filter media can last twice as long - 6 .

## Sand filter
Sand filters are used as a step in the water treatment process of water purification.. There are three main types; rapid (gravity) sand filters, upward flow sand filters and slow sand filters.All three methods are used extensively in the water industry throughout the world. The first two require the use of flocculant chemicals to work effectively while slow sand filters can produce very high
