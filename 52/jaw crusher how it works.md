## How Does A Jaw Crusher Work? - Groovy Ghoulies
Jaw crushers work according to the principle of pressure reduction. The crushing of the crushed material takes place in the wedge-shaped shaft between the fixed and the eccentric shaft moving crushing jaw. Due to the elliptical movement process, the crushed material is crushed and transported downwards. This process will be done by using the

• Single Toggle Jaw Crusher • These both motions, when combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists in pushing the particles through the crushing chamber. • This phenomena leads to higher capacity of the single toggle jaw crushers but it also results in higher wear of the crushing jaws.

Jaw crushers use mechanical pressure to break the material by forcing it between two vertical jaws, one stationary and one that is driven back and forth. The gap between the two jaws narrows as the material moves through the crusher, further reducing the size.  Vertical shaft mills work on the same principal as VSI crusher, with a rotor on a
