## Belt Driven Live Roller (BDLR) Conveyors | Advanced Equipment Co. - AECMD
Belt Driven Live Roller (BDLR) Conveyors are a versatile way to convey products of various shapes, sizes and weights. Products such as boxes, cases, drums and totes are ideal for the bolt together product line. When conveying heavier loads like appliances and loaded pallets, welded construction is a more suitable choice.
