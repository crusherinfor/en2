Kaolin clay, after purification and beneficiation, is widely used as a filler and pigment in various materials, such as rubber and resins, and in various coatings, such as paints and coatings for paper. Crude kaolin clay, as mined, contains various forms of discoloring impurities, two major impurities being anatase (TiO.sub.2)and iron oxides.

## 3 examples of magnetic separation
Magnetic separation is the process of using magnetic force to remove metallic or ferrous materials from a mixture. Magnetic separation machines consist of a vibratory feeding mechanism, an upper and lower belt and a magnet. The bulk material is fed through the vibrating mechanism onto the lower belt. At this point, the magnet pulls any material.

## Synthesis of ZSM-5 from impure and beneficiated Grahamstown kaolin 
Raw kaolin obtained from Grahamstown, South Africa was beneficiated using wet sieving and filtration before use in the synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolite via hydrothermal treatment at various temperatures ( °C) and times (24-96 h) under autogenous pressure. The impacts of kaolinite content and crystallisation parameters (i.e. temperature and time) on ZSM-5 formation were investigated.
