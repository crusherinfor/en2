## Quartz Sand - Sandatlas
Sand from this formation is extensively used in hydraulic fracturing (fracking). Width of view 7 mm. Quartz is the most important sand-forming mineral because it is resistant to both physical and chemical weathering. Sand that is enriched in quartz is likely old (mature) and has traveled far from the source area, sometimes thousands of kilometers.
