## Crushing and Grinding Process - JXSC Machine
The crushing and grinding operations are an important part of the processing of mineral resources, and it is also operation with high investment and high energy consumption. In the case of metal mines, equipment investment in crushing operations accounts for 65% to 70% of the total plant value, power consumption is about 50% to 65%, and steel consumption is as high as 50%.

The crushing process often requires different stages of grinding, since there is no crusher or mill capable of converting large mineral formats into micronized fines. Thus, our range of crushers and mills covers the whole size reduction process, from the primary crushing stage to the refining grinding.
