Secondary treatment involves aerating the wastewater. The water is aerated (or shaken up) to release dissolved gases such as hydrogen sulfide. Aeration also replenishes oxygen, which is consumed by decaying organic matter found in wastewater. Bacteria are also used at this stage to consume nutrients and organic materials.
