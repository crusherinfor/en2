## The Potential Negative Effects Of Mining On The Environment, Animals 
Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants. This can lead to air pollution via air contaminants, release of greenhouse gases like methane and CO2

## How can mining become more environmentally sustainable?
Mining can become more environmentally sustainable1 by developing and integrating practices that reduce the environmental impact of mining operations. These practices include measures such as reducing water and energy consumption, minimizing land disturbance and waste production, preventing soil, water, and air pollution at mine sites, and conducting successful mine closure and reclamation

## Analysis of land damage degree considering terrain factors in coal 
Land damage resulting from mining activities, especially precious farmland, is an increasingly hot topic, and damaged land should be properly reused to meet human demand through land reclamation. Accurate estimation of land damage degree is of great importance in the reuse planning of damaged land resources. Generally, it is inaccurately analysis without considering original terrain factors

Mining is an inherently invasive process that can cause damage to a landscape in an area much larger than the mining site itself. The effects of this damage can continue years after a mine has shut down, including the addition to greenhouse gasses, death of flora and fauna, and erosion of land and habitat.

## Office of Wastewater Management - Hardrock Mining: Environmental Impacts
Hardrock Mining: Environmental Impacts. Overview. Hardrock mining is a large-scale industrial activity that takes place in the natural environment, potentially disturbing large amounts of material and land area. Hardrock mining generates large volumes of mining waste because of the high waste-to-product ratios associated with producing most ores.

## How Mining Companies are Reducing the Environmental Impact of Mining
Mining leaves an eyesore on the land. By ripping open mountains to extract the ores within, it sometimes leaves areas unusable after the mining companies have left. We can't go on this way, and politicians agree. It's why mining companies are working to reduce the environmental impact of mining through green mining processes.
