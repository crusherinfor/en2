During this process the coke undergoes severe mechanical, thermal and chemical stresses. One of these is the CO 2-gasification which may lead to a decisive mechanical weakening of the lump coke by

## Raw materials - Coking plant | ArcelorMittal
Coking plant. To make steel in a blast furnace, coal must first be turned into coke. Coke has a dual role in the steelmaking process. First, it provides the heat needed to melt the ore, and second, when it is burnt, it has the effect of 'stealing' the oxygen from the iron ore, leaving only the pure iron behind. In the coking plant, coal is

## Coking
Coking is the heating of coal in the absence of oxygen to a temperature above 600 °C to drive off the volatile components of the raw coal, leaving a hard, strong, porous material of high carbon content called coke.Coke consists almost entirely of hydrocarbons.The porosity gives it a high surface area, which makes it burn faster (as does a sheet of paper versus a wooden log).

Coking coal, or metallurgical coal, has been produced in the United States for nearly 200 years. Coking coal is primarily used in the production of coke for use in the steel industry, and for other uses (for example, foundries, blacksmithing, heating buildings, and brewing). Currently, U.S. coking coal is produced in Alabama, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.
