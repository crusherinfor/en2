## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
/ JAW CRUSHER TYPES. There are two main groups of jaw crushers, categorized according to their jaw movement mechanism. - Single-toggle jaw crushers - Double-toggle jaw crushers. In single-toggle jaw crushers, the movable jaw is supported by the bearing on an eccentric shaft driven by the pitman to which it is attached.

## Lubricating crushing machines in quarries - Rock to Road
The actual crusher can be in the form of a cone, gyratory, impact, jaw, etc. - type machine. Common to all crushers is the requirement for lubrication, be it oil lubrication (e.g. for gear boxes) or grease (e.g. for bearings). The pure nature of crushing rocks produces many possible issues and considerations to tend with on a daily basis.

These are the Jaw Crusher Components and components that produce the breaking action and provide the energy needed to crush the ore. Let's look at the chain of events along a broken cycle and see how they fit together. The first part of the crusher is the drive motor. This will drive the reducer sheave connected to the eccentric shaft.
