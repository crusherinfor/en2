## Rossi Mine - Barite, Elko County, Nevada - schopine
Ivanhoe Mining District. T37N R49E. In the western pan-handle of Elko County, there is the Rossi Mine. It is an intentionally quiet, professional barite mining operation, lost in the hustle and bustle of the large gold mines surrounding it. But, in truth, it has been there, producing ore, off and on, long before the current gold rush.

## Mining Process Of Barite Mining
Most barite is produced using open pit mining techniques, and the barite ore then typically undergoes simple beneficiation methods to separate the mineral from the ore. Methods such as washing, jigging and tabling, which involve separating it in water or shaking it, are used to isolate the dense material.

Oct 13, 2020Barite mined in Missouri was predominantly from open pits. Prior to World War I, barite was mined exclusively by hand, recovering only the larger pieces and leaving the smaller fragments behind. After World War I, mining by hand gave way to more modern mechanized mining methods, making recovery of smaller pieces economical.
