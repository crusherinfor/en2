## Quartz vs. Quartzite Countertops | CounterTop Guides
The resin used in manufacturing quartz countertops is a plastic, so it is prone to melting in heat above 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Where quartz has an advantage over quartzite is that it is less prone to denting and chipping because it is more flexible. Both countertop materials can be scratched by sharp objects, and a cutting board should be used.

## Quarries | Northern Stone Supply
When the water drained from the ancient Snake River Plain, wind and water continued to deposit feldspars and silica which compressed into quartz sandstone. After a billion years of heat and pressure, this lake bed was metamorphosed into stratified quartzite which now sits at elevations of up to 7,000 feet. The sedimentary layers which we quarry
