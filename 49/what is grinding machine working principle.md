## Centerless grinding
Working principle. In centerless grinding, the workpiece is held between two wheels, rotating in the same direction at different speeds, and a workholding platform. One wheel, known as the grinding wheel (stationary wheel in the diagram), is on a fixed axis and rotates such that the force applied to the workpiece is directed downward, against the workholding platform.

With the in-feed method, the regulating wheel spins the part at one speed while pushing it towards the grinding wheel, which is spinning at a faster speed. The greater the difference in speeds, the faster the removal rate. 4. The choice of grinding wheel is critical. Another key factor in centerless grinding is the choice of grinding wheel.
