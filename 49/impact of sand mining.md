Documenting The Global Impacts Of Beach Sand Mining. For centuries, beach sand has been mined for use as aggregate in concrete, for heavy minerals, and for construction fill. The global extent and impact of this phenomenon has gone relatively unnoticed by academics, NGOs, and major news sources. Most reports of sand mining activities are found

While some methods have less impact than others, it almost always has a serious and lasting environmental impact. Fortunately, there is some hope that mining will become more sustainable in the future.

## WFD 2020: Impacts of River Sand Mining on Riverine Fisheries
The primary impact of River Sand Mining is the loss of habitat for vegetation, invertebrates, fishes, turtles, crocodilians, birds, and mammals. This means the loss or shrinking of breeding/spawning sites, loss of food and ultimately changes in fish populations and community composition. Aquatic biodiversity is susceptible to increases in
