## Copper Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
Copper is usually found in nature in association with sulfur. Pure copper metal is generally produced from a multistage process, beginning with the mining and concentrating of low-grade ores containing copper sulfide minerals, and followed by smelting and electrolytic refining to produce a pure copper cathode.

The absence of a clear pricing signal, particularly a futures reference price, itself adds to the unpredictability of lithium supply.

## Copper extraction
The average grade of copper ores in the 21st century is below 0.6% copper, with a proportion of economic ore minerals (including copper) being less than 2% of the total volume of the ore rock. A key objective in the metallurgical treatment of any ore is the separation of ore minerals from gangue minerals within the rock.

## Calculation of Ore Tonnage & Grade from Drill hole Samples
The area influenced by any given hole is found as follows: (1) Divide angle at hole by 180°. (2) Multiply total area of entire prism by above result. (3) Multiply area found by (2) by the average thickness (found by solution of the formula) of ore in the hole, which thus transforms this smaller prism into volume.
