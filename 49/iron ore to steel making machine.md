## Iron- and Steel-Making Process | SpringerLink
Iron is extracted in the form of metallic iron (Fe) by reducing the oxide ores with a reducing agent. The principal agents commonly employed to serve this reduction process are the naturally occurring forms of carbon such as coke, charcoal and coal. In order to extract the iron, Fe (55-60%)-rich ore is usually used.

Making steel. Steel is made from iron ore, a compound of iron, oxygen and other minerals that occurs in nature. The raw materials for steelmaking are mined and then transformed into steel using two different processes: the blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace route, and the electric arc furnace route. Both processes are being continually improved

Steelmaking has played a crucial role in the development of ancient, medieval, and modern technological societies. Early processes of steel making were made during the classical era in Ancient Iran, Ancient China, India, and Rome.. Cast iron is a hard, brittle material that is difficult to work, whereas steel is malleable, relatively easily formed and a versatile material.

Phosphorus in steel makes it brittle. For steel-making the limit for phosphorus is one hundredth of one per cent for ten per cent of iron in the ore; this is the so-called Bessemer limit. A Bessemer ore carrying 52% of iron must not have more than .052% of phosphorus and the sulphur should not exceed .04%.

Pig iron, also known as crude iron, is an intermediate product of the iron industry in the production of steel which is obtained by smelting iron ore in a blast furnace.Pig iron has a very high carbon content, typically 3.8-4.7%, along with silica and other constituents of dross, which makes it very brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications.
