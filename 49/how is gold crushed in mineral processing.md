## How gold is extracted by Cyanidation Process - Refresh Science
The chemical that is used in the separation of gold from a rock is mercury. After the rock containing gold has been crushed to powder form, mercury is added to get the gold from the powder. Gold is dissolved in mercury to form an amalgam, just like the other minerals. In addition to that, using the cyanide solvent, gold is dissolved from its ore.
