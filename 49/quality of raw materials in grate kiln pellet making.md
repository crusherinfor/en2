## Predictive models and operation guidance system for iron ore pellet 
This model was primarily developed for static heat hardening of pellets on moving grate. For grate-kiln system, pellet temperature profiles within two devices can be estimated by the coupled model proposed in this study, and residence time on the grate can be obtained via moving speed while residence time in rotary kiln can be estimated by Eqs.
