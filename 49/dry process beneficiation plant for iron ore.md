## Iron Ore Beneficiation Process
By beneficiation is meant all methods of removing impurities, and raising the iron content to a point where it can be sold in open market, the principal impurities being silica and moisture. The general processes to which low grade iron ores are amenable are as follows: Thermal (a) Drying; removes hydroscopic or atmospheric moisture.

Size classification will require screening, de-sliming and cycloning. In the case of a lower-grade iron ore, the beneficiation process includes activities such as crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening and silica froth flotation. These activities will help improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ore - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Beneficiation of Iron Ore and the treatment of magnetic iron taconites, stage grinding and wet magnetic separation is standard practice.This also applies to iron ores of the non-magnetic type which after a reducing roast are amenable to magnetic separation. All such plants are large tonnage operations treating up to 50,000 tons per day and ultimately requiring grinding as fine as minus 500

## Dry beneficiation of contaminated iron ore fines (0-2 mm sizes), using 
The dry beneficiation process can also be used for up-grading contaminated iron ore lumps of 5-20 mm size, after screening. All the contaminants by way of BHQ & iron-stones can be separated from high grades of iron ore. At present, such contaminants from the iron ore lumps can be separated only after making sponge iron in the rotary kiln.
