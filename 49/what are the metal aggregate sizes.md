## Gradation and Size - Pavement Interactive
The particle size distribution, or gradation, of an aggregate is one of the most influential aggregate characteristics in determining how it will perform as a pavement material. In HMA, gradation helps determine almost every important property including stiffness, stability, durability, permeability, workability, fatigue resistance, frictional resistance and moisture susceptibility (Roberts et

## What is an Aggregate? - Definition from Corrosionpedia
It is mostly used in construction. Aggregates are inert materials like sand, gravel, crushed stone, slag and recycled aggregates. The aggregate of a composite needs to be much smaller than the finished item and should come in a wide variety of sizes for efficient filling. Aggregates account for between 60 to 75% of the total volume of concrete.

## What Size Is #57 Stone? - Dirt Connections
Coarse aggregates use grading that ranges from 1 to 8. The #1 aggregate has a nominal size of 3.5 to 1.5 inches, while the #8 aggregate has a nominal size of 3/8 to .094 inch. #57 aggregate gets its name because it is a combination of the #5 and #7 aggregates, which means that its individual pieces range in size from 1 to 0.19 inch.

## Aggregates - Cement
Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete. After harvesting, aggregate is processed: crushed, screened, and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.
