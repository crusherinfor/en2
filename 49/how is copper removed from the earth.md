The rock is drilled and blasted, then moved to the surface by truck, belt conveyor, or elevator. Once at the surface, the material is sent to a mill to separate the ore from the waste rock. Lower grade metal ores found closer to the surface can be profitably mined using surface mining methods, which generally cost less than underground methods.

## How Is Copper Formed?
The process of crystallization makes the rock shrink, forming cracks, and the fluid that is left moves into those cracks. By this point, the fluid contains a great deal of copper, so by the time it solidifies, it is almost pure copper. The deposits appear when the rocks on top of them erode, exposing the copper to mining operations. ADVERTISEMENT

## Solved Copper and zinc both occur in the Earth's crust as - Chegg
Copper and zinc both occur in the Earth's crust as their metal sulfides: CuS (pyrite) and ZnS (zinc blende). The first step in extraction of the metal is roasting the ore in air: 2ZnS + 3O2 → 2ZnO + 2SO2 The sulfur dioxide is used in the manufacture of sulfuric acid and the oxide is reduced by carbon in a blast furnace: ZnO + C → Zn + CO 1.

A soluble chloride is added to the sulphate solution of copper and the proper amount of sulphurous acid is added. Moderate heat under pressure—90° C. of heat—precipitated almost all the copper as sub-chloride. The subsequent process of obtaining the copper without volatilization and the recovery of the chlorine offered difficulties.

Copper mining is usually performed using open-pit mining in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the earth over time. To remove the ore boring machinery is used to drill holes into the hard rock and explosives are inserted into the drill holes to blast and break the rock.

Impurities have to be removed. Copper is purified by electrolysis. In this process copper is transferred from an impure anode to the cathode of an electrolytic cell. The insoluble impurities fall to the bottom. The copper produced by this process is 99.99% pure copper. This is similar to the electrolysis that is done in a school lab.
