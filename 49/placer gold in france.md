Biological and Geochemical Development of Placer Gold . Placer gold from the Devils Nest deposits at Rich Hill, Arizona, USA, was studied using a range of micro-analytical and microbiological techniques to assess if differences in (paleo)-environmental conditions of three stratigraphically-adjacent placer units are recorded by the gold particles themselves.

## placer gold in france
Gold prospecting as a fun activity is very much alive in France. There are many streams that contain placer gold, albeit in small amounts, in the southern region of the country. The major hunting grounds for gold prospectors are rivers that make their way to France from Switzerland. Another potential gold mining area is the Loperec River.

## How Bering Sea Gold's Purity Stacks Up to Other Alaskan Gold
Dude, gold from the Bering Sea is some of the purest in Alaska, and the whole country. Overall, placer gold purity in any specific area can be a tricky thing to pin down as it can change in a fairly small area. You might be mining 90% - 92% pure gold but move 50 feet in a different direction and the purity can drop down to 80% - 85%.
