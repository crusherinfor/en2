## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## THE QUARRY PROCESS - The Gunlake Group | Advanced Concrete & Quarries 
Crushing can be done in three or four stages, primary (first stage), secondary (second stage), tertiary (third stage) and, in some quarries, a quaternary (fourth stage). Crushed rock, or product, is transported along the process line on conveyor belts or down chutes. The primary crusher is fed via a chute and vibrating feeder.

Mobile plants allow the combination of prescreening - that prepares the rock for the crushing process and grading, which precisely separates defined aggregate particle sizes into different end products - to be integrated with the crushing unit into one single machine. In the first stage, the material is screened using an active prescreen.

Crushing is the first step in converting rock into usable products. Essentially, crushing is no more than taking large rocks and reducing them to small pieces. Crushing is sometimes continued until only fines remain. Blockage incidents can be greatly reduced by supplying rock that is properly sized to match the primary jaw opening.
