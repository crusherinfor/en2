W = Pf/2 = P²L/2AE = A²S²L/2AE = S²/2E x AL. When P/A = S. If, to simplify the mathematics of the demonstration, we assume the particle under load a cube of edge D, then A = D 2, L = D, S 2 /E is an assumed constant, and. W = S²/2E x D³. or the work of deformation is proportional to the volume of the particle deformed.

## 5 tips for energy efficient and productive cone crushing
Improper drive belt maintenance will result in high horsepower consumption at a low crusher throughput tonnage, this inefficient use of connected horsepower will result in a higher energy cost per ton of material crushed (kW/hr per ton). Drive belt condition, alignment and tension should be checked on a weekly basis (40 hours).
