Graphite is common as a minor mineral in many kinds of metamorphic rocks, including marbles, schists, and gneisses. The origin of the carbon is usually organic material in the original sediments.  According to some geologists, the metal-rich ore fluid came from oxidized clastic iron-rich rocks. 9.3.3 Sedimentary Ore Deposits 9.3.3.1 Placer

metamorphic rock lies in between surficial processes (as in sedimentary rock ) and magma in the rock cycle . Heat-driven metamorphism begins at temperatures as cold as 200˚C, and can continue to occur at temperatures as high as 700°C-1,100°C. Higher temperatures would create magma, and thus, would no longer be a metamorphic process. Temperature

What is Iron Ore? Earth's most important iron ore deposits are found in sedimentary rocks. They formed from chemical reactions that combined iron and oxygen in marine and fresh waters. The two most important minerals in these deposits are iron oxides: hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ).

## Metamorphic Rocks: Changes to Mineral Structure | AMNH
Metamorphic rocks form when sedimentary, igneous, or pre-existing metamorphic rocks are changed by heat, pressure, and chemically reactive waters. These rocks are identified by their minerals and texture. During metamorphism, new minerals grow, with different sizes, shapes, and orientations than those of the original minerals.

Metamorphic rocks form by subjecting a rock ( protolith) to pressure, temperature, and chemically active fluids. When identifying metamorphic rocks, it is common for geologists to focus on specific 'indicator minerals' that serve as clues about the degree of metamorphism a rock has undergone. To identify an igneous rock, first identify its texture.

Mapping of metamorphic complexes using remote sensing technology is essential for searching metallic and nonmetallic ore deposits (Kotnise and Chennabasappa 2015).Many of the largest deposits of base and precious metals are located in metamorphic terrains (Spry et al. 2000) which are important geological features in orogenic systems (Eskola 1948; Teyssier and Whitney 2002).

Structurally, the Golgohar iron ore deposit is located on the eastern edge of the Sanandaj-Sirjan magmatic-metamorphic zone and in the foreland of the Zagros Ranges (Mücke and Younessi, 1994; Alavi, 2004).The Zagros orogenic belt, a curvilinear part of Alpine-Himalayan collisional orogenic belt (Stocklin, 1968; Berberian and King, 1981; McClay et al., 2004), forms the northeastern of the Afro
