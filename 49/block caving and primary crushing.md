## Productivity of a Continuous Mining System for Block Caving Mines 
Block caving mining is one of the most cost-effective underground mining methods.  and a primary crusher. Early crushing of the mineral was introduced to avoid grizzlies on ore passes and to allow proper operation on conveyors belts. Each feeder extracts ore from the draw points, which feeds the conveyor equipped with a primary crusher

## Numerical modeling of influence parameters in cavabililty of rock mass 
1. Introduction. Block caving is a method that is completely based on the principles of caving. This method is based on the assumption that ore fractures and breaks by itself, due to the presence of internal stresses and forces caused by the weight of the ore body and also the downward movement of the broken rocks. 1 The deposit is divided into large blocks, usually square in shape.

block caving is the only underground mining technique that achieves production rates equivalent to surface mining. However, it is only suitable for ore bodies with large horizontal and vertical extents. , the primary working hazard of block caving is that the undermined ore body may not collapse continuously.

## Block Caving
Overview. Block caving is an underground hard rock mining method that involves undermining an ore body, allowing it to progressively collapse under its own weight. It is the underground version of open pit mining. In block caving, a large section of rock is undercut, creating an artificial cavern that fills with its own rubble as it collapses.

The fracturing and the disposal of ore are obtained by the action of gravity and efforts resulting from tectonic and lithostatic stress.
