## Extracting gold from rock - OpenLearn - Open University
When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.

These numbers report that the cost of extracting an ounce of gold is actually over $1,000 per ounce, well above the aforementioned numbers. And since gold is currently trading at just over $1,200 per ounce, it explains why mining companies have had less-than-stellar profits. Determining the costs of mining largely depend on the region as well.

Fill it up about halfway and then place the rock in the water (assuming it's small enough to do so). You can measure how big the rock is by how much water is displaced. If the water line moves up 3/4 of a cup then that's how big the rock is. You can use Google to convert that volume to cubic centimeters.

This is where the problem lies with a lot of gold miners. More than 10% of gold mined is lost in this 100 year old cyanide solution using activated carbon.
