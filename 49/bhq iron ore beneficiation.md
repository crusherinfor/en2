## benefication of bhq iron ore from goa
iron ore is expected to rise by more than 200 million tonne per year to meet the internal demand & export. This additional requirement of iron ore will need beneficiation of low grade ore/fines to get the major portion of increased demand. This paper deals in brief to use of available methodologies for beneficiation of iron ore in Indian context.

To identify and establish beneficiation techniques for banded hematite quartzite (BHQ) iron ore, a comprehensive research on BHQ ore treatment was carried out. The BHQ ore was assayed as 38.9wt% Fe, 42.5wt% SiO 2, and 1.0wt% Al 2 O 3 . In this ore, hematite and quartz are present as the major mineral phases where goethite, martite, and magnetite are present in small amounts.

## Iron ore | BHP
What is iron ore? Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted. There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red.

BHQ ores generally contain 35-38% Fe, 42-45% SiO 2, and 0.5-2.5% Al 2 O 3, while BHJ ores contain 40-45% Fe, 38-40% SiO 2, and 1-1.5% Al 2 O 3 [ 1, 2, 3 ]. These low-grade iron ores require beneficiation before they can be used in a blast furnace. The overall productivity and profitability of steel plants depends on the quality of

## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

##  Indian Iron Ore Scenario : Low Grade Iron Ore Beneficiation - MECON
Low Grade Iron Ore Beneficiation In the past 50 years, due to high demand and intensive mining operations, the high grade deposits are depleting fast. By it is estimated that the relatively low grade reserves are to be tapped. The importance of tailings can be understood by this proverb
