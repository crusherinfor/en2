## Symons Cone Crushers - SolidsWiki
Working Principles. When the cone crusher is working, the engine rotates around a fixed point through the belt wheel or the coupling, Meanwhile the transmission shaft and the conical part of the cone crusher are taken under the force of the eccentric bushing, which makes the crushing wall close to the pierced mortar wall at intervals.

## Difference Between Standard and Short Head Cone Crusher
The maximum feed size is 300 mm, and the discharge size is about 20-40 mm. The short head cone crusher can be used for tertiary or quaternary crushing (fine crushing). The maximum feed size is 120 mm, and the output size is 5-20 mm. There are three designs for standard head and end cone crusher: "coarse", "medium" and "fine".

Purpose of Crushers. A crusher is a machine designed to reduce the size of large rocks to smaller rocks, gravel, sand, or rock dust; this is essential for efficient transport of the product via conveyors etc. Crushing is the first of many stages that lead to separation of the mineral (s) from the waste (gangue) material.

Gyratory crushers work on the same principle as cone crushers (Figure 4.4(c)). These have a gyratory motion driven by an eccentric wheel. These machines will not accept materials with a large particle size and therefore only jaw or impact crushers should be considered as primary crushers. Gyratory and cone crushers are likely to become jammed
