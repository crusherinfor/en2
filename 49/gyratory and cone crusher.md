## Cone crusher basics in 4 minutes — SRP
Cone crusher basics in 4 minutes This is the starting point for understanding how cone crushers work - and how they can make your mine or quarry more productive. Elsewhere on the site you can find detailed information about all aspects of crushing and screening, but to make sense of these it helps to understand the basics of cone crushing.

Cone Crushers; Typically, the initial crushing stage is completed using either gyratory crushers or jaw crushers. It is often the case that there will be only one crusher installed, and this will be referred to as the primary crusher. Cone crushers are more often used for 2nd, 3rd & 4th stage crushing steps (although not always).

## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The gyratory crusher shown in Figure 2.6 employs a crushing head, in the form of a truncated cone, mounted on a shaft, the upper end of which is held in a flexible bearing, whilst the lower end is driven eccentrically so as to describe a circle. The crushing action takes place round the whole of the cone and, since the maximum movement is at the bottom, the characteristics of the machine are
