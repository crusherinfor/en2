## Ostriv lime kiln-beach-radio
The kiln is filled with 6 layers before burning, going limestone-charcoal-limestone-charcoal. The stock only shows the ingredients of the current layer. I think this is the problem. It should show the ingredients from the lower layers so that it can be emptied. You should report this. #15 < 1 2 > Showing 1 - 15 of 18 comments Per page: 15 30 50.

##  Limestone Quarrying and Processing: A Life-Cycle Inventory
Commercially, the term limestone includes dolomite, dolomitic limestone, oolitic limestone, and travertine (Dolley 2007), a porous calcitic rock that is commonly formed near hot springs. The leading stone produced in the US, limestone accounts for 42% of total domestic production.
