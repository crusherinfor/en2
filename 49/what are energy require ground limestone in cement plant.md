Finely ground limestone can replace 5% to 15% of portland cement. Portland-limestone cements require less energy to produce because the limestone is not pyroprocessed like the portland cement it replaces. Best energy consumption. Typical cement plant power costs can range from EUR39 to EUR170/MWh. Mill designs.

## Synergic effects of the substitution of Portland cement for water 
The coupled use of calcined clay and ground limestone has been a promising alternative to partially replace Portland cement due to the synergic effects between these two additions. Therefore, substituting calcined clay with a material of similar chemical composition, such as water treatment plant sludge ash (WTPSA), yields several environmental advantages.
