The Valheim smelting system is pretty similar to how it works in most other games — you'll have to put ore into a Smelter to get bars, and then you use those bars to make items. Here's the entire process from start to finish: Get a Pickaxe. Mine Ore. Gather some Wood. Put Wood in your Charcoal Kiln to make Coal.

## Health Risks Of Iron Ore Open Pit Mining
Open pit mining, where material is excavated from an open pit, is one of the most common forms of mining for strategic minerals. This type of mining is particularly damaging to the environment because strategic minerals are often only available in small concentrations, which increases the amount of ore needed to be mined.

Open pit mining is used for the extraction of both metallic and nonmetallic ores. Open pit mining is considered different from quarrying in the sense that it selectively extracts ore rather than an aggregate or a dimensional stone product. Open pit mining is applied to disseminated ore bodies or steeply dipping veins or seams where the mining

## Open-Pit Mining | Method and Process | Epiroc US
Open-pit mining differs from quarrying (with the possible exception of iron ore) in that the valuable mineral constitutes only a small proportion of the total tonnage of rock produced. In quarrying, the rock itself is the valuable commodity, with virtually all of the raw rock that is won being processed (often only by crushing and screening) to

## Mining | National Geographic Society
Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

The excavation can run deep, but unlike underground mining, the activities take place in the open air. That eliminates or reduces some of the risks involved in mining. But working in the open air doesn't mean that workers can breathe easily. Open pit mining produces large quantities of dust, which is a significant hazard in and of itself.
