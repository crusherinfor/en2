## Working Principle and Advantage of Bucket-wheel Sand Washing Machine 
The working principle of the bucket wheel sand washing machine: During operation, the motor rotates slowly through the V-belt, reducer and gear, and the impeller rotates slowly. The gravel has a feed trough into the washing tank, which is tumbling under the impeller and grinds each other to remove impurities covering the surface of the gravel.

Working Principle of Friction Clutch: In a car, disengagement occurs between engine and gearbox by applying force over the clutch thus the springs are compressed by the peddle and the pressure plate slide to backward. After this situation, the clutch plate has become free between the flywheel and the pressure plate. Now the clutch can shift gears.

## The working principle of a washing machine is : how washing machine works?
The working principle of a washing machine is the centrifugal and centripetal forces. Washing machines operate in two primary cycles. These are the wash cycle and the rinse cycle. The wash cycle involves the principle of centrifugal force. The direction of this force is from the inside to the outside, which ensures that every part of the fabric
