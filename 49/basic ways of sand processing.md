Sand casting involves four basic steps: assemble the sand mold, pour liquid metal into the mold, allow the metal to cool, then break away the sand and remove the casting. Of course, the process is more complex than it sounds. The first step of mold assembly is to partially fill the drag with sand.

## basic ways of sand processing
it is still common to process gravel simply by screening to a maximum top size.A great benefit is gained from processing the material by crushing. This means that a good percentage of the stone will be fractured in the crushing process.The broken stones will embed into the surface of a gravel road much better than rounded, natural-shaped stone.

Salt also may be found in domes, which were formed when Earth pressures forced salt up through cracks in the bedrock from depths as great as 30,000 or 40,000 feet; they resemble plugs of almost-circular shape a few hundred yards to a mile across. Some domes occur close to the surface. Both domes and veins are mined in a similar way.

On the other side, most castings are worked in their finishing stages. Sand castings generally have a rough finish, and often parts of the casting will be machined to be smoother, or the right size. Many iron and steel castings will rust if not sealed in some way and protecting against this oxidization is another almost universal finishing step.
