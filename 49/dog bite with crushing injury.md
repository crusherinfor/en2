## dog bite with crushing injury
When dog bites occur they often result in crush injuries because dogs have rounded teeth and strong jaws; thus, the bite of an adult dog can exert up to 200 pounds per square inch of pressure. This pressure can result in a crushing injury, causing damage to the nerve or even sever a nerve.

A dog's bite may not fully penetrate the skin, but the strength of the dog's jaws can lead to severe puncture wounds, crushing injuries, nerve damage, and blood loss. Some dogs that bite aggressively will shake their heads violently as a reflex; this is what a hunting dog would do to prey to immobilize it once the dog has its teeth on the animal.
