## Quality Control 101: What Is a Sieve Analysis and Why Does It Matter?
Sieve Analysis: Step by Step. The procedure of sieve analysis starts with the stacking of sieves, or screens, from the largest to the smallest size. Typically, the mesh of these sizes can range from 1 inch or 25.4 mm to what's known as the "No. 400" or .037 mm of an opening. Then, the bulk aggregate is placed carefully on the top sieve

Sieve Analysis. In order to determine the relative proportion of different particle sizes available in an aggregate mix, sieve analysis or gradation test is to be performed. In this test, the sieves are arranged in descending order of their opening sizes and are stacked over each other as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5: Stack of Sieves.

## Why should the sieve analysis of fine aggregate be conducted  - Quora
Answer (1 of 4): Well, if you conduct if after, you have to deal with concrete! The reason the test is conducted is to ensure either well-graded fine aggregate or that the fine aggregate is of a gradation conducive to filling the voids in the coarse aggregate and the cement water slurry.

## Sieve analysis
A sieve analysis (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used in civil engineering and chemical engineering to assess the particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a granular material by allowing the material to pass through a series of sieves of progressively smaller mesh size and weighing the amount of material that is stopped by each sieve as a fraction of the whole mass.
