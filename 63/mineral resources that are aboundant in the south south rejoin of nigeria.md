## Lithiumphabet
Lithium can be extracted in different ways, depending on the type of the deposit - it is generally done either through solar evaporation of large brine pools or by hard-rock extraction of the ore. In India, alongside the rock mining at Mandya, there is some potential for recovering lithium from the brines of Sambhar and Pachpadra in Rajasthan.Lithium Deposits in the United States.
