ADVERTISEMENTS: One of the most important phases of plant layout is to achieve an optimum effective flow of materials (raw materials, and in-process materials) through the plant. Naturally the principle of minimum movements (i.e., number of movements and distance travelled in one move) forms the basis for optimum effective flow.

L Shaped Factory Layout. An L shaped layout example is used when the layout flows around a corner. It is usually the least space efficient as it is hard to make use of the space on the inside of the L. Also, material handling pathways to the outside of the "L" are often long. Product also starts and finishes in opposite corners of the layout.
