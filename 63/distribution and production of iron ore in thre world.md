## Titanium production by countryer-grid
The production of titanium metal accounts for only 5 percent of annual titanium mineral consumption; the rest goes to the titanium pigment industry. Pigments are produced using either a sulfate process or a more environmentally acceptable carbo-chlorination process (described below) that converts TiO2 into TiCl4. The latter process also supplies the TiCl4 necessary for the production of.
