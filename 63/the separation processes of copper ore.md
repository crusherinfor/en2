copper processing, the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. In its pure form or as an alloy, copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure, and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

The ways to obtain successful Separation of Copper and Lead into individual Concentrates, several process approaches can be examined; bulk copper-lead flotation with a reverse flotation stage depressing copper, the same bulk flotation with a reverse flotation to depress lead and a sequential copper-lead-zinc flotation circuit as well as a simple cleaning of the bulk Cu/Pb concentrate by Pb

## Publicly owned treatment works or POTW means any device or system used 
An in-depth literature review on Li-ion battery recycling via pyrometallurgical processes was recently performed by Makuza et al. 192 One possible option is the use of these end-of-life batteries as secondary feedstock material in the primary extractive metallurgy of cobalt, nickel and copper process routes, which is actually done by companies.
