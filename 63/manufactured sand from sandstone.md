## The Pros and Cons of Manufactured Sand - The Screed Scientist®
This can help in reducing the sand mining from river beds. Lesser impurities and good working properties: Manufactured sand is free of silt and clay particles, and has denser particle packing than natural sand. It also offers higher flexural strength, better abrasion resistance, higher unit weight and lower permeability.

## How Sandstone is Formed - Gosford Quarries
Sandstone is a rock comprising mostly of minerals formed from sand. The stone gains its formation throughout centuries of deposits forming in lakes, rivers, or on the ocean floor. These elements group together with the minerals quartz or calcite and compresses. In time, the sandstone is formed by the pressure of these minerals coming together.
