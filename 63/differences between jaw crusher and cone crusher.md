## Should I Choose an Impact Rock Crusher or Cone Crusher? - Sepro Aggregates
Cone Crusher Applications. Cone crushers, a type of compression crusher, have less versatility than a horizontal impact crusher, but a great capability to guarantee a finished product size. If set at 2", typically 80% of the final product will meet the 2" target which is not something that can be replicated by jaw crushers or impact crushers.

## Differences between cone crusher and jaw crusher.
The gyratory body of cone crusher is higher, twice or three times of jaw crusher, and the workshop cost is larger.
