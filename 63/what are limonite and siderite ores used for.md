## Optimization of Siderite Ore Sintering Operation Conditions
Research was сarried out on a pilot plant on sintering of various size siderite ore and limonite taken in various ratios. To study impact of a number of process factors on the sintering process performance and the obtained agglomerate quality at the minimum number of the carried out experiments, one of the experiment planning methods was used, and regression equations were derived.
