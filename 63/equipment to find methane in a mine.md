## Sustainable Application Of Reciprocating Gas Engines Operating On Coal 
The anthropogenic release of methane (CH4) into the environment is a byproduct of the coal mining process and the global warming potential of this methane continues to draw attention globally. Stakeholders responsible for coal and power production are looking for ways to safely and economically mitigate the release of coal mine greenhouse gases.

##  Coal mine methane - Environmental Change Institute
Coal mine methane (CMM) is the term given to the gas trapped in coal seams, which has an approximate chemical composition of 70% methane, 15% carbon dioxide and 15% nitrogen. The gas is released once the seams are mined and can then escape to the atmosphere. Internationally, the UK was the sixth largest producer of coal mine methane in 1990,140

Coal Mining & Methane. Coalbed methane occurs naturally in coal seams. Methane recovered from underground coal mines is generally grouped under the term Coal Mine Methane (CMM). 2 key factors influence CMM recovery : mine safety and the opportunity to mitigate significant volumes of methane emissions arising from coal mining activities.

Methane explosions in mines Methane explosions in mines are the result of the concentration of a methane leak in a closed environment. If methane reaches a critical concentration in the air, which is between 5 to 15 % it can react with the oxygen to form carbon dioxide, water and heat. This reaction needs a source of ignition to begin.

Eat a lot of beans. That usually helps me. Edit: to be more useful, look on a map and find a sector that has blue or purple areas in it.

You can also select the appropriate mining ship for the resource you're looking for then

A person would wear a wet blanket over his shoulders and head and carried a long wick with its end lit on fire. This brave person entered the mine and began to move the flame of the wick along the walls of the mine. When the man would hit a small pocket of methane gas, it would ignite, but the miner remained fairly safe under the dampened blanket.

## What does a mining machine operator do? - CareerExplorer
A mining machine operator might be exposed to contaminants or hazardous equipment. Methane in coal seams can escape into tunnels, and miners sometimes hear it hissing. Explosions can injure workers who are many yards away, and cave-ins can trap or bury workers. Flooding is another problem mining machine operators must sometimes contend with.

This is evidenced by ingenious burners which, owing to metal screens with high-density meshes, did not let the flame into the surrounding environment, thus preventing explosion.
