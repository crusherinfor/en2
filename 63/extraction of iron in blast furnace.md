The blast furnace is the first step in producing steel from iron oxides. The first blast furnaces appeared in the 14th century and produced one ton per day.  blast furnace, structure used chiefly in smelting. The principle involved in this means of extracting metals is that of the reduction of the ores by the action of carbon monoxide, i.e

## Recovery of Lead from Lead Blast Furnace Slags
The cost of a TCLP extraction and analysis can typically cost over $200 per sample. The cost of pyro or hydrometallurgical treatment of blast furnace slags is usually high due to the nature of the processes and the required capacities. Thus it is important that revenue be generated by the recovery of metal values during the treatment process.

At the bottom of the furnace the iron ore is chemically reduced. The blast reacts with the coke; carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are formed at temperatures of up to 2000 °C. The carbon monoxide removes the oxygen from the iron ore resulting in pig iron production. Slag is formed from the other ore components and the additions.

The charge is loaded into the top of a tall furnace called blast furnace . Hot air-the blast is pumped into the lower part of the furnace. The ore is reduced to iron as the charge falls through the furnace. A waste material called slag is formed at the same time. The slag floats on the surface of the liquid iron produced.

## In the extraction of iron the slag produced is?
2 Blast furnace slag. Blast furnace slag (BFS) is a by-product from iron production in blast furnaces, which are fed by a mixture of iron-ore, coke and limestone. In the process, the iron ore is reduced to iron while all remaining materials form the slag, which is tapped off as a molten liquid and cooled.

## Iron Extraction Manufacturing Process - Blast Furnace Method
Fe 2 O 3 is reduced to iron mainly by carbon monoxide and to some extent by coke. Reactions of iron extraction. Fe 2 O 3 reduction to iron is done step by step. Temperature variation along the blast furnace will help to occur these reactions. Now, we can study what are the reactions occurring inside the blast furnace at different temperatures

## The extraction of iron | Exhibition chemistry | RSC Education
Although a good example of what happens in a blast furnace, this demonstration lacks because the students don't see and appreciate what I would call 'pure iron'. Extracting iron. Here I use a gentle supply of oxygen at the surface of the reaction mixture to generate the high temperatures (>1000ºC) necessary for the direct reduction of iron
