## History of Copper | When Was Copper Discovered? - Worldcoppersmith
In North America, extraction of copper started with marginal working by Native Americans. Native copper is said to have been extracted from mines on Isle Royal using stone tool around 800 - 1600 BC. Around 1000 AD, copper metallurgy was fast flourishing in South America especially Peru; it spread at a much lower rate across other continents.

## Affinity purification of copper chelating peptides from chickpea 
Abstract. Chickpea protein hydrolysates obtained with alcalase and flavourzyme were used for purification of copper chelating peptides by affinity chromatography using copper immobilized on solid supports. The chelating activity of purified peptides was indirectly measured by the inhibition of beta-carotene oxidation in the presence of copper.

## Extraction Of Copper | Mining, Concentration, Smelting - Byju's
Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace. The major steps in the extraction of copper are. Copper in Chalcopyrite is reduced to copper sulphide. Just like in Blast Furnaces, calcium carbonate is added as a flux to create the slag.

The purification uses an electrolyte of copper (II) sulfate solution, impure copper anodes, and strips of high purity copper for the cathodes. The diagram shows a very simplified view of a cell. At the cathode, copper (II) ions are deposited as copper. At the anode, copper goes into solution as copper (II) ions.
