Dec 27, 2020 Â· There's been an upsurge in the number of people fossicking for gold, sapphires, emeralds and opals in Queensland's hotspots for precious metals and gems. More than 18,000 fossickers' licences have been issued in just the last two financial years. With gold worth nearly $2,500Aus, fossicking can be very rewarding.. "/>

Gold may form in exhalative deposits formed on the sea floor associated with Archean basaltic sequences known as greenstone belts. It may form in veins associated with large granite intrusions associated with mountain building. It may also form in veins formed along major fault zones. Gold in veins is associated with sulfides, quartz, and calcite.

In 1863, alluvial gold was found at Canal Creek, west of Warwick in the Gladstone region; and in 1865 at Gavial Creek, which is a branch of Crocodile Creek in the Rockhampton Goldfield.  â¢ Other gold deposits have been found in the alluvial beds of the St. George River and several streams that drain eastwards from the Dividing Range.

## Â» Placer Gold Deposits Pay Off!
Definition: Deposits representing the transitional stages between a residual and alluvial placer deposit (deposits which form in route between the lode erosion and drainage system). Residual gold tends to form accumulations in soil or colluvium by "creeping" along with material down a hill-slope.. Examples: Klamath Mountain region, California and Oregon.

## Examples of minerals found in alluvial deposits include?
Answer and Explanation: 1. Alluvial deposits may contain minerals like tin ore, gold, platinum, gemstones. Such deposits of valuable ores are also called placer deposits. The minerals found as placer deposits have high specific gravity so that they undergo gravity separation during sedimentation by rivers.
