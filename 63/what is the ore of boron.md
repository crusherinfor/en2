## Boron - The Crustal Element - Elements
Boron is a quintessential element of the Earth's upper continental crust. Processes that created the upper continental crust also enriched it in boron, and, as a result, a great diversity of boron minerals are among the most accessible of useful compounds to humankind, even in antiquity. And humankind is most fortunate that crustal processes have.

## Boron deficiency in humansartage.fr
First symptoms of boron deficiency : Young leaves become curled in vigorous papaya plants. Second symptoms: Tips of the leaves turn pale green in healthy plants. Third symptoms: Fruit is becoming shapeless and indifferent shape due to lack of boron . If older papaya plants show this deficiency >, they cannot be recovered in older plants.

## Boron sodium oxidere-more.shop
Boron combines with oxygen and other elements to form boric acid, or inorganic salts called borates. Boron compounds, chiefly borates, are commercially important; therefore, boron products are priced and sold based on their boric oxide (B. 2. O. 3) content, varying by ore and compound and by the absence or presence of calcium and sodium.

Boron is a trace mineral found in many foods and in the environment. It is also available as a dietary supplement. It is called an ultra-trace mineral, which means it is required in very minute quantities in the diet.. Boron doesn't come under the category of essential nutrients for humans because there isn't any clear evidence regarding the biological function of boron.
