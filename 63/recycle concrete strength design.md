## Civil Engineering 101: Why Should We Recycle Concrete?
Dec 19, 2021This means a lesser need for mining or more mining resources for other use. Perhaps the greatest advantage of concrete recycling is its construction application. Rather than use fresh concrete, there are construction activities that utilize recycled concrete like in road foundation, landscape materials, soil stabilization, and pipe bedding.

## Recycled Concrete Aggregates - Its Uses, Properties, Advantages 
The shear strength of recycled aggregate concrete is lower than of normal concrete. This is because the recycled aggregate from field-demolished concrete for example can be relative to natural aggregate. In general, there is a 10% decrease in strength when recycled coarse aggregate is used. Advantages and Disadvantages of Recycled Concrete

Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete. Recycled aggregates are classified in one of two ways, as: Recycled Aggregate (RA), or as. Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA).

However, the major drawback of the recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) has been the contribution of the cement paste mortar attached to the surface.

In comparison, other related topics, such as the effect of RCA on the bond strength of deformed steel rein-forcing bars14-15 and on the 28-day strength and stiffness of concrete16-18 have been investigated. Directly addressing the inherent variability of RCA prop-

## Crushed Concrete Aggregates - Properties and Uses of Recycled 
By and large, strength of concrete produced from crushed concrete aggregate is lower than concrete made using natural aggregate. Strength reduction of concrete produced from recycled coarse aggregate and natural fine aggregate ranges from 5 to 24%. This influenced by strength of crushed concrete, water to cement ratio of crushed and new concrete.

## Workability and Early-Age Strength of Recycled Aggregate Concrete 
ASTM Type I cement, natural aggregates, recycled concrete aggregates, dune sand, and tap water were used in the preparation of concrete mixes. The gradation curves of dune sand and cement are shown in Figure 1.  As for the 60-MPa design strength concrete, the addition of up to 1 and 3% of 43- and 20-mm BF, by volume, increased the splitting

## However,u-putz
However, concrete may crack, heave, or buckle during the cold months. The salt used for melting ice can also smudge, stain, or pit concrete, causing ugly marks.It also takes ice and snow longer to melt when it falls on concrete compared to asphalt.Asphalt Must Be Resealed and Concrete Stains Easily. According to a number of studies of concrete roads vs asphalt roads over the past decade
