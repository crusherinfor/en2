## Build Green: The Importance of Environmentally-Friendly Construction 
Well-Rounded Energy, Water, and Material Efficiency. Buildings that are eco-friendly have greatly improved efficiency on three fronts: energy, water, and materials or resources used. In terms of energy, the goal is to reduce how dependent the building is on using energy, especially any that is used from non-renewable resources, like coal.
