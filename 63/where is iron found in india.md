Manganese is not found as a free element in nature. It is often found in combination with iron. The most important manganese ore is pyrolusite. Manganese is primarily used in iron and steel industry. It is the basic raw material for manufacturing steel alloys. 6 kilograms of manganese ore is required for manufacturing one tonne of steel.
