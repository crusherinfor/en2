Sand mining and its associated activities serves as a source of livelihoods for entire communities whilst on the other hand it can trigger conflicts and violation of human rights. This study is aimed at assessing the socio-economic impacts caused by sand mining in the rural communities of the Wild Coast of South Africa.

Abstract: Using a cause-effect chain model to determine the effects of sand mining on Sandwich terns. Dredging leads to an increase of silt concentrations in the water column, which makes it more difficult for Sandwich terns to catch fish.

However, the process of sand mining has accelerated coastal environmental degradation to an alarming rate in many areas. As a result the government has been compelled to spend millions of dollars to combat sea erosion. This paper examines the causes and effects of coastal sand mining in three communities in the Ahanta West District of Ghana.
