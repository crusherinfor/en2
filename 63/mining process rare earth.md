## Dysprosium: Occurrence, mining and use of the rare earth
Actually is dysprosium not a rare resource, but in contrast to other metals, it often occurs in the earth's crust.What makes the raw material so rare, however, is the complex mining process. In contrast to other raw materials such as gold, dysprosium is not concentrated in individual areas of the earth's crust.

## Rare-earth mining - AccessScience from McGraw-Hill Education
The REEs were first commercialized during the 1880s, when rare-earth oxide mixtures were used to make incandescent mantles for gas lights. The REEs were extracted from monazite mined from coastal heavy-mineral placer deposits in Brazil and India. Similar mixtures found applications in steel making.

Aug 12, 2021For every ton of rare earth produced, the mining process yields 13kg of dust, 9,600-12,000 cubic meters of waste gas, 75 cubic meters of wastewater, and one ton of radioactive residue. This stems from the fact that rare earth element ores have metals that, when mixed with leaching pond chemicals, contaminate air, water, and soil.
