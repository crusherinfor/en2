## tools for copper ore mining
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively, due to the different

Mining is a useful gather and can be a good money-maker. Mining, like Herbalism, gives you a small amount of experience when you gather a mine. This helps leveling up from 50-60 -- every bit counts! Mining is primarily allied with Blacksmithing, Engineering, and Jewelcrafting, and remains the primary gathering profession for all three.

Lake Van, in present-day Armenia, was the most likely source of copper ore for Mesopotamian metalsmiths, who used the metal to produce pots, trays, saucers, and drinking vessels. Tools made of bronze and other copper alloys, including chisels, razors, harpoons, arrows, and spearheads, have been discovered that date to the third millennium BCE.

Copper Mining . In ancient times learned how to obtain copper from the ore by heating the rock to the metal melting point. They used to mould bronze objects by pouring the metal into stone shapes or ingots. In modern world copper is produced by processing the ore to obtaining copper concentrate which is a major raw material for smelters.
