## Stone Cutting Techniques: Feather & Wedge, Guillotine, Wire Saw
Quarries and stone manufacturers use diamond-wire cutters for precise and clean cutting of stone slabs. The wire is extremely long and runs from a motorized spool, attached to a vehicle on a track. The process is similar to that of someone slicing through a piece of cheese. However, the harder the stone, the more difficult it will be to make a cut.

## Production of Natural Stone | Norges Geologiske Undersøkelse - NGU
Natural stone must be carefully quarried and preferably removed as large blocks. The first step is to take down the "primary block", which is a large dimensioned chunk of rock loosened from the quarry wall. This is most often achieved by drilling, blasting or/or sawing. A primary block can vary in size depending on the stone type, and up to 1000 cubic metres, 2700 tons!
