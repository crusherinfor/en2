## Clean process for the production of defluorinated dicalcium phosphate 
A new process for the production of defluorinated dicalcium phosphate using phosphate rock was developed. This new process has the main characteristic of being clean, without the production of any liquid waste. The process has essentially three main steps: phosphate rock digestion, defluorination and neutralization.

## DICALCIUM PHOSPHATE (DENTIFRICE GRADE) - Entrepreneur India
Dicalcium phosphate is of great interest to tooth paste manufactures. It is used in toothpaste in its anhydrous variety. Although this product is not included in the accepted dental remedies, it is nevertheless used because of its considerably higher abrasive power compared to dehydrate.

## Production of dicalcium phosphate by treatment of phosphate rock 
This paper presents results laboratory experiments to test a new process for manufacture of dicalcium phosphate. The process is based on the nitric acidulation of phosphate rock concentrate, followed by neutralization of the extract liquor with calcium carbonate. The precipitated dicalcium phosphate is then separated from calcium nitrate solution by filtration. The dicalcium phosphate thus

A calcium phosphate mineral with the chemical composition CaHPO 4 2H 2 O is Dicalcium Phosphate Dihydrate (DCPD), also known as Brushite. DCPD is structurally nearly identical to gypsum, as well as the dimensions of its unit cells. Unlike arsenate, which forms a mineral called Pharmacolite, DCPD phosphate is isomorphous with arsenate.
