8.2.3.1 Open pit mining. Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.

Typical open cut grades. Gold is generally extracted in open-pit mines at 1 to 5 ppm (parts per million) but in certain cases, 0.75 ppm gold is economical. This was achieved by bulk heap leaching at the Peak Hill mine in western New South Wales, near Dubbo, Australia.. Nickel, generally as laterite, is extracted via open-pit down to 0.2%. Copper can be extracted at grades as low as 0.11% to 0.2%.

The Chuquicamata ('Chuqui') mine is the second deepest open pit mine in the world, at a depth in excess of 850 metres and the largest open-pit copper mine in the world. Located in the north of Chile, the mine has been operation since 1910, and is now owned by Codelco, a state-owned operation since the Chilean nationalisation of copper mining.

## What is Open Cut Mining? | Bravus Mining & Resources
Nov 30, 2021Open-cut mining is a process of resource extraction where it is dug up from the surface. Also known as open-pit mining or open-cast mining, it is the most common form of extraction for minerals or coal in Australia. The technique of open-cut mining is used when the deposits are close enough to the surface to be readily extracted.
