## Hike to an Abandoned Quarry and Railway Ruins - Ms Adventure
While facing the quarry the ruins are hidden downhill in the trees behind you. Continue a bit past the pond. Shortly after, on your left you'll see some debris scattered around a bit off-trail. Although covered in snow, you can see the remains of rusty buckets and pipes scattered on the ground.
