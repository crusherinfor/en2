## During the electrolysis of the aqueous solution of copper sulphate?
What happens during electrolysis of copper sulphate? Whenever copper sulfate or CuSO 4 is added to water, it gets dissolved in the water.As CuSO 4 is an electrolyte, it splits into Cu + + (cation) and SO 4 − − (anion) ions and move freely in the solution. Now we will immerse two copper electrodes in that solution. What is the product of electrolysis of copper sulphate?

## Reinventing copper extraction with electricity | MIT News 
Antoine Allanore, the Thomas B. King Assistant Professor of Metallurgy at MIT, wants to simplify copper extraction and eliminate noxious byproducts through electrolysis. "If you look at the energy consumption of a copper smelter today, it's enormous," Allanore says. "They are dependent on electricity already to exist.

Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace. The major steps in the extraction of copper are. Copper in Chalcopyrite is reduced to copper sulphide. Just like in Blast Furnaces, calcium carbonate is added as a flux to create the slag.

## Copper Purification Process - Electrolytic Copper Refining Plant
Electrolytic refining (electrorefining) is a process used to make impure copper pure. Unlike aluminum, copper metal is fairly easy to obtain chemically from its ores. By electrolysis, it can be refined and made very pure—up to 99.999%. The electrorefining is at the heart of not only copper purification, but the production of sodium hydroxide

## During the purification of copper by electrolysis:
In purification of copper by electrolysis, anode is made up of impure Cu sheet, cathode is made up of pure Cu strip and CuSO 4 is used as electrolyte. For every copper ion that is deposited at the cathode, in principle, another one goes into solution at the anode. The concentration of the solution should stay the same.

Purification: Many metals are impure when they are extracted from their ores. Impurities have to be removed. Copper is purified by electrolysis. In this process copper is transferred from an impure anode to the cathode of an electrolytic cell. The insoluble impurities fall to the bottom. The copper produced by this process is 99.99% pure copper.

Sulphuric acid is added initially, as a weak solution, to help produce a dilute copper sulfate solution extraction from copper ore.  After the solution has concentrated with more copper sulfate, the concentrated solution undergoes electrolysis, which causes the copper to precipitate out of the solution.

Most copper is mined in the form of the ores chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), chalcocite (CU2S), and malachite (Cu2C03(0H)2). The sulfides are most abundant and yield copper metal when heated strongly in the presence of oxygen. In Section 17.6 we discussed applications of electrolysis in the extraction and purification of metals from their ore sources.

## How can electrolysis be used to purify copper? | Socratic
Feb 16, 2014. Electrolysis of copper transfers copper atoms from an impure copper anode to a pure copper cathode, leaving the impurities behind. Unrefined copper is about 99 % pure. It contains traces of metals such as Fe, Zn, Ag, Au, and Pt. The purity can be increased to 99.95 % by electrolytic refining in a cell similar to that shown below.

## During the purification of copper by electrolysis:
During the purification of copper by electrolysis: A. the anode used is made of copper ore B. pure copper is deposited on the cathode C. the impurities such as Ag, Au present in solution as ions D. concentration of `CuSO_4` solution remains constant during dissolution of Cu
