Calculation of volume of aggregate in 1m^3 of concrete. Volume of aggregate = Ratio of aggregate / (Cement+Sand+Aggregate) x 1.57. = 3 / 5.5 x 1.57. = 0.86 m ^3. Now, assuming 1 cubic meter of aggregate = 1500 kgs (because the bulk density of every type of aggregate is different) Hence, 0.86m^3 of aggregate = 1500 x 0.86 = 1290 kgs.

When making your own concrete it's important to use the correct concrete mixing ratios to produce a strong, durable concrete mix. Some basic mixing ratios for concrete are 1:2:3, 1:3:3, 1:2:4. These mixing ratios are based on the proportions of cement : sand : stone in that order. The ratio you use will depend on what psi strength you need.

Use these simple steps to get started with your own batch of concrete. 1. Fill the wheelbarrow or mixing tub with sand. 2. Add water to the cement mixture while stirring constantly, until it is saturated but not soupy in texture. 3-4. Slowly add cement while stirring the mix to ensure even distribution.

## How Cement, Sand and Aggregate ratios influence Concrete  - Happho
Total Aggregate by cement ratio (A/C) decreases with increase in grade of concrete. For example, M20 grade of aggregate will have a higher A/C ratio than of M30. Higher the Aggregate/Cement ratio leaner the concrete mix, as cement content is lower. Concrete mix can be made more workable by fine tuning Aggregate/Cement ratio.

Generally, the water to cement ratio for the nominal mix ( M10, M15, M20, and M25) falls under 0.4 to 0.6 as per IS Code-10262 (2009). Lower water to cement ratio results in higher strength and durability but makes the concrete mix hard to work with and form. But this problem can be resolved by the use of plasticizers and superplasticizers.
