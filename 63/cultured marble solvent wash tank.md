## Yellow stain on porcelain sink-freiheit
How to clean it: Most stains can be handled with a warm soapy water rinse. If a heavier stain does occur (like an oil stain ), Angie's List cleaning expert Amanda Bell suggests applying a baking soda paste, which draws out the oil, covering with plastic wrap, then letting it sit overnight. In the morning, wipe up with warm water and a soft cloth.

## cultured marble - Ask the Builder
Cultured marble is easy to care for once installed. Avoid any cleaning product that contains abrasives. Use a squeegee after each shower to quickly remove water drops from walls. Hard water deposits can be dissolved easily with white vinegar applied from a spray bottle. Apply the vinegar and wait for 45 minutes to an hour.
