Sep 23, 2019The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

## Extraction of Metals from Ores - Different Processes Involved - VEDANTU
The basic extraction of metals from ores has the following steps. Grinding and Crushing. The bigger chunks of the ore extracted are crushed and ground in ball mills and crushers. It helps to increase the surface area of the chunks for better chemical actions later. In technical terms, it is called pulverisation.

## Process for the production of aluminium
(a) Leaching of alumina from bauxite The principal ore of aluminium, bauxite, usually contains SiO2, iron oxides and titanium oxide (TiO2) as impurities. Concentration is carried out by digesting the powdered ore with a concentrated solution of NaOH at 473 - 523 K and 35 - 36 bar pressure. Aluminium is mostly extracted from its bauxite ore

We can extract the iron by reacting the iron oxide with a more reactive element. The more reactive element takes away the oxygen. The raw materials are Haematite (iron ore), Coke (impure C), Limestone (CaCO 3) Make a strong reducing agent. C + O 2 → CO 2. CO 2 + C → 2CO. Reduce the iron 3. Fe 2 O 3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO 2.

Steel. Iron is commonly found in the Earth's crust in the form of an ore, usually an iron oxide, such as magnetite or hematite.Iron is extracted from iron ore by removing the oxygen through its combination with a preferred chemical partner such as carbon which is then lost to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.
