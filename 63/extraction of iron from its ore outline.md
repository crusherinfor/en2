## Extraction of Metals from Ores - Different Processes Involved - VEDANTU
The basic extraction of metals from ores has the following steps. Grinding and Crushing. The bigger chunks of the ore extracted are crushed and ground in ball mills and crushers. It helps to increase the surface area of the chunks for better chemical actions later. In technical terms, it is called pulverisation.

(a) Leaching of alumina from bauxite The principal ore of aluminium, bauxite, usually contains SiO2, iron oxides and titanium oxide (TiO2) as impurities. Concentration is carried out by digesting the powdered ore with a concentrated solution of NaOH at 473 - 523 K and 35 - 36 bar pressure. Aluminium is mostly extracted from its bauxite ore

Steel. Iron is commonly found in the Earth's crust in the form of an ore, usually an iron oxide, such as magnetite or hematite.Iron is extracted from iron ore by removing the oxygen through its combination with a preferred chemical partner such as carbon which is then lost to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.
