Modern milling procedures produce many different flour streams (approximately 25) that vary in quality and chemical analysis. These are combined into four basic streams of edible flour, with four other streams going to feed. Top patent flour: This stream is composed of only the purest and most highly refined streams from the mill.

Modern Methods of Milling. Our most important task is selecting great grains for our flour and the blending of these different varieties to give precisely the right baking qualities. Milling great flour is not simply about crushing the grains into a powder. It is about separating the parts of a "berry" of grain into its constituent fractions.

Commercial milling removes the nutrient-filled part of the kernel, namely the germ, bran, and endosperm. When milling your own whole wheat, these are included in your final result, making your flour more nutritious than its commercial counterpart.

The flour is then used in the production of bakery products, pasta, breakfast cereals, pet foods and snacks. 1.

Roller milling involves the wheat being passed through a series of steel rollers, each rotating at a different speed. These crush the grain and separate the outer bran layer from the inner endosperm. The endosperm is passed through several more rollers, the wheat germ is removed and the final product is plain (white, refined) flour.

## Stages Of Flour Milling
Flour Milling Process. After wheat washing and wheat conditioning the grinding steps of separating bran endosperm and malt can be carried out. The whole flour milling process is divided into rough grinding purification and fine grinding. Rough grinding is to slightly split the skin of wheat grains and take out of the coarse grains and flaky.
