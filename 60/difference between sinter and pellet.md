## How are sinters produced? Explained by FAQ Blog
What is difference between sinter and pellet? The typical iron (Fe) content of sinter is around 55-58%, while BF pellets are normally 62-66% Fe. BF pellets have a higher Fe content as they are manufactured from low- grade ores that are finely ground prior to undergoing mineral beneficiation treatments.
