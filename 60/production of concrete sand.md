## Concrete made from desert sand | I'MNOVATION
Sand is one of the basic materials in the production of concrete. But, although it would seem an abundant material, the type of sand that can be found in the deserts is too thin and smooth to bind properly. And thus, construction companies resort to riverbank sands, a dwindling resource. A group of young researchers from the Imperial College

## Sandcrete Blocks: Production, Specifications, Uses, and Testing
Sandcrete blocks are precast composite masonry units made of cement, sand, and water and are moulded into various sizes. According to the British Standard (BS 6073: 1981 Part 1), a block is a heterogeneous building material with a unit that is larger in all dimensions than what is required for bricks, but no dimension should be larger than 650 mm or the height should be six times the thickness

## Concrete production: an ideal option for foundry sand?
The results of the physical properties revealed foundry sand probably cannot replace regular concrete sand in its entirety. However, concrete, masonry blocks and paving stones showed very promising possibilities for foundry by-products. In general, the specified strength of normally used structural grade concrete is PSI.
