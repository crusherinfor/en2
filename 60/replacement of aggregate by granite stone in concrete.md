## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
In total aggregate, the proportion of sand to coarse aggregate (C.A) is altered depending on fineness of sand. Fineness modulus (F.M) measures the degree of fineness of a fine aggregate, lower value of F.M indicates finer particles. Fineness modulus of fine aggregate is calculated by sieving fine aggregate on standard sieve sizes starting from
