Fig-1 Crushing Test Setup. One of the model in which pavement material can fail is by crushing under compressive stress. A test is standardized by IS: 2386 part-IV and used to determine the crushing strength of aggregates. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under gradually applied crushing load.

## Various Lab Test On Aggregates - Civil Engineering Portal
There are many tests which are conducted to check the quality of aggregates. Aggregates are very important component of concrete, so the quality really matters when it comes to aggregates. Various test which are done on aggregates are listed below. 1. Sieve Analysis 2. Water Absorption 3. Aggregate Impact Value 4. Aggregate Abrasion Value 5.

## Aggregate Crushing Strength Test - Online CivilForum
The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.

Sampling for Crushing Test of Aggregate. For the Aggregate crushing value test, an aggregate sample passing through a 12.5 mm IS sieve and retained on a 10mm IS sieve is selected and dried to a temperature of 105 ºC to 110 ºC then cooled to room temperature.. To fill the cylindrical measure mold about 6.5 kg of a sample of aggregate is sufficient.
