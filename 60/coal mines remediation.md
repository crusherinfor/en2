## Coal Mine Information - Nanaimo
Background: Coal was the primary resource that gave Nanaimo its start in the 1800s. It was mined in various locations around Nanaimo from 1852 until the 1950's. Coal is found in sedimentary rock along underground seams varying in depth and thickness. The process of removing coal from these seams created open spaces (or mine tunnels) which miners temporarily reinforced using timbers or other means.
