## 6 Steps To Build Aggregate Planthcrusher
In the aggregate plant, we should choose suitable crushing equipment according to different raw materials. First of all, when we classify the raw materials, we can roughly divide the raw materials into hard stone and soft stone. Hard stone is mainly represented by cobblestone, granite and basalt, and its hardness is basically above 150Mpa.
