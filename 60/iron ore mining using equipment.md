## Understanding Iron Ores and Mining of Iron Ore - IspatGuru
Nearly all the large iron ore mines in the world, with the exception of a few, are being worked by open pit methods. The process of mining iron ore requires massive resources. These resources include heavy industrial mining equipment and a skilled labour force.

## Iron Ore Mining | Axora
Steel production could not exist without iron ore. Open-pit mining techniques are commonly used to extract iron ore, involving the use of heavy machineries to excavate a vertical pit above a deposit. However, mining iron ore is an energy intensive process that requires the use of blasting and drilling.

## Mine Planning and Optimisation Techniques Applied in an Iron Ore Mine 
The iron ore mine is an open pit operation whereby the material movement method is load and haul. The load and haul is done through shovels, Front End Loaders (FEL) and haul trucks. The material is drilled, blasted and then loaded into haul trucks. The haul trucks then transport the ore to the crusher and waste to the waste dumps.

Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two categories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.

## Major Mines & Projects | Iron Ridge Mine
Open pit mining using conventional drilling and blasting, followed by loading and hauling by excavators and trucks was selected as the preferred mining method. The mine will consist of a single open pit operation adopting 10m benches and mining these benches in 3 flitches. Ore and waste will be hauled to the ROM pad and waste dump respectively.
