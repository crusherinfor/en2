## LARCO GMMSA - Nickel
The use of nickel is dominated by the production of ferronickel for stainless steel (66%). However, it is also used in the production of non-ferrous alloys (12%), alloy steels (5%), plating (7%), foundry (3%) and batteries (2%). Ferronickel is primarily used in the manufacture of Austenitic stainless steels (known as 200 and 300 series). These

## Ferronickel Facts: This Ferroalloy Contains Mainly Iron And Nickel - Kidadl
Ferronickel is made from nickeliferous laterite by means of pyrometallurgical processes. It usually contains iron and nickel, with a percentage ratio between 20:80-35:65. Ferronickel can be used in the production of stainless steel, low alloy steel, and other related alloys that contain approximately 65% nickel.

Nickel oxide ore is usually called laterite, which represents 61% nickel ore on earth and 40% of world is in the form of laterite. Laterite ore normally classifide into two groups:  Feed material for ferronickel production is predominantly saprolite, rather than limonite. This is because the iron content of the saprolite ore about 15% Fe, is

The nickel ore deposits in the Kosovo are of oxide laterite type. The NewCo Ferronikeli plant is a two line plant. It was built in 1984 using largely Soviet technology, but with certain elements such as the electric furnaces, rotary kilns and casting machines, based on Western designs.

## Pilot plant production of ferronickel from nickel oxide ores and dusts 
Laterites and other oxidized nickel ores constitute a very important part of world-wide nickel reserves. The development of nickel oxide ore smelting has drawn heavily on iron and steel metallurgy. In ferronickel production, the nickel oxide and part of the iron oxide are reduced to metal in an electric furnace to form immiscible layers of slag

## Pilot plant production of ferronickel from nickel oxide ores and dusts 
Mintek has been working on the production of unrefined ferronickel from nickel-containing lateritic ores and dust in DC-arc furnaces since 1993. The development and various advantages of the DC-arc furnace technology developed at Mintek has previously been described in detail (Jones et al., 1993; Lagendijk et al., 1994). In essence, nickel

These dependencies are necessary for the choice of the composition and development of ferronickel production technology. Burned ore raw materials were subjected to a selective carbothermal reduction in the laboratory electric arc furnace. In the obtained ferroalloy the nickel content decreased from 65 to 3%, phosphorus - from 0.68 to 0.38%
