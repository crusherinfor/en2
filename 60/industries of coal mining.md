2. Fires. One of the most devastating calamities that could happen in a coal mine is a fire or an explosion. The fires can be caused by short-circuits in the electrical equipment or mechanical faults in the machines used. Since coal is already a very combustible material, the effects of a fire inside the mine will be especially devastating.
