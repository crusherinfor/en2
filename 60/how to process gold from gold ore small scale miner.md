In many cases, the gold minimum content will be even higher, depending on the circumstances of the miner, the capacity of his equipment and the type of ore processing he needs to do to recover it. Normally the small-scale miner is seeking free gold and often does not have the capacity to recover gold from difficult to work sulfide ores.

On the other hand, large-scale mining utilizes simple to sophisticated mining technology and machinery to mine and process ore. Overview and Scale. Africa's mineral industry is highly characterized by artisanal and small- scale mining (ASM) operations. This is so in areas producing gold, diamonds and precious/semi-precious stones.

## How to Identify Gold Ore?
The gold ore can be identified if the heavy metal is a bright yellow color. The first step in determining whether you have struck gold ore is to identify what type of gold ore you have. There are several ways to do this, including using a metal detector. Some gold detectors can detect gold as small as a half-grain diameter.

Identify gold ore by physical properties. （A）Tarnish: Gold nuggets or small pieces of gold are usually bright and free of stains. If you find some rust on the surface of the ore, it is likely to be pyrite. （B）Color: Most native gold is alloyed with silver, and if the silver content is high enough, the ore will have a whitish-yellow color.

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## Ways To Process Gold Ores - JXSC Machine
Jun 4, 2021The use of gold and other minerals than the difference in flotation. The larger the difference in specific gravity, the easier to separate. The gold-bearing sands are placed into the cylinder sieve and flowed through the high-pressure water, and the gravel sands larger than the sieve holes are transported into the tailing field through the chute and belt; the sands smaller than the sieve holes

## Small Portable Gold Process Plant - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
This arrangement and flowsheet of a Mini Portable Gold Processing Plant permits several mineral separations by flotation and provides for the possible recovery of other minerals by gravity concentration. The flowsheet is ideal for a pilot-plant in field testing of ores to determine the economic feasibility of an ore deposit prior to the installation of a larger plant or for processing ore
