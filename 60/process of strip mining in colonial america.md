Open Pit Mining. Open pit mining is similar to area mining. The technique is common in the western United States (and other parts of the world) where very thick — 50 to 100 foot — coal seams exist. Open pit mines are usually large operations. Production levels may exceed 10 million tons of coal per year.. The thick coal seams found at these large mines ensure that the amount of land

Scope: Strip Mining is a form of coal extraction that falls under the umbrella of surface mining. As opposed to conventional mining practices where coal miners travel deep underground leaving the surface intact while removing coal, strip mining is performed by removing earthen materials, known as overburden, and then xextracting coal seams.

Strip Mining. Strip mining gets its name from the fact that the process involves stripping the surface away from the mineral that's being excavated (usually coal). Soil, rock, and vegetation over the mineral seam is removed with huge machines, including bucket-wheel excavators. This type of mining makes sense when the mineral is near the surface.

Mining practices were relatively sophisticated by the 1500s in Europe, especially in Germany. The same technologies used in Europe were installed in early colonial mines. An excellent reference on 1500s era mining is De Re Metallica by Agricola, wriiten in 1556. The techniques shown here were highly relevant until the early 1800s.
