## Minerals and Rocks | Let's Talk Science
Rocks containing valuable minerals are called ore. Minerals from ore are used to manufacture products that we use every day. This includes things like houses, stainless steel pots and pans, electronics, batteries, automobiles and fertilizer. Valuable minerals include base metals, industrial minerals and precious metals.

## What Are The Similarities Between Rocks And Minerals?
Although there may be many differences between rocks and minerals there are only a few similarities between them. Rocks as well as minerals are found in the Earth's crust (the outer layer of the Earth). Another similarity between the two is that rocks as well as minerals both have commercial value. Jul 22 2015

Three Types of Rock Rocks fall into these three groups: Igneous, Sedimentary, and Metamorphic Igneous rocks are formed from melted rock deep inside the Earth. Sedimentary rocks are formed from layers of sand, silt, dead plants, and animal skeletons. Metamorphic rocks formed from other rocks that are changed by heat and pressure underground.

Metamorphic rocks include gneiss, schist, phyllite, slate, marble, hornfels, and skarn and various other types of metaigneous and metasedimentary rocks. Many types of minerals, both common and obscure, are also present.

On the other hand, extrusive rocks are formed when molten magma spill over to the surface as a result of volcanic eruption. The magma on the surface (lava) cools faster on the surface to form igneous rocks that are fine grained. Examples of such kind of rocks include pumice, basalt, or obsidian. 2. Sedimentary Rocks.

## Difference Between Rocks and Minerals
The main difference between rocks and minerals is that the rocks are aggregates of different kinds of minerals whereas minerals are naturally occurring inorganic chemical compounds. What are Rocks. As mentioned above, the formation of a rock is a slow and complicated process where many different types of minerals can get trapped inside.

Igneous rocks form when molten rock (magma or lava) cools and solidifies. Sedimentary rocks originate when particles settle out of water or air, or by precipitation of minerals from water. They accumulate in layers. Metamorphic rocks result when existing rocks are changed by heat, pressure, or reactive fluids, such as hot, mineral-laden water. Most rocks are made of minerals containing silicon

Types of Rocks There are three basic types of rock: igneous sedimentary and metamorphic. Extremely common in the Earth's crust igneous rocks are volcanic and form from molten material. What are the minerals? A mineral is a naturally occurring inorganic solid with a definite chemical composition and an ordered atomic arrangement.
