The cumulative percentage retained on each sieve is added and subtracted by 100 gives the value of fine aggregate. Higher the aggregate size higher the Fineness modulus hence fineness modulus of coarse aggregate is higher than fine aggregate. Coarse aggregate means the aggregate which is retained on 4.75mm sieve when it is sieved through 4.75mm.
