## Zinc Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Cadmium is a relatively rare metallic element that occurs naturally in the environment in association with zinc ores and, to a lesser extent, with lead and copper ores. The sources of pollution are different in nature, and range from industrial complexes releasing wastewater to cigarette smoke and rock mineralization processes (Figure 1).Release of cadmium to aquatic systems occurs mainly

## Cadmium Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart | Cases - JXSC
Cadmium (Cd) is a very soft, silvery-white metallic element that can be cut with a knife. Cadmium has many chemical similarities to zinc and is often recovered from the primary zinc ore sphalerite. The single most important use of cadmium is in the production of nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cad) batteries.

Cadmium is associated in nature with zinc (and, less closely, with lead and copper) and is extracted mainly as a byproduct of the mining and processing of zinc. In 2000, it was refined in 27 countries, of which the 8 largest accounted for two-thirds of world production. The United States was the thir d largest refiner after Japan and China.

## Arsenic, Cadmium, Copper, and Zinc
It is a naturally occurring element found in water and earth and especially near its close relative, zinc. Long-term cadmium exposure is harmful to kidneys and lungs. From 1787 to 1837, pennies were made of pure copper. Blood contains copper. Copper in the blood is essential, a component in enzymes for producing energy.

## Cadmium - GreenFacts
Cadmium is produced mainly as a by-product of mining, smelting and refining of zinc and, to a lesser degree, as a by-product of lead and copper manufacturing. Most of the cadmium produced is used in the production of nickel-cadmium batteries, which in 2004 represented 81 per cent of the total amount of cadmium.
