The deeper the mining level gets, more sophisticated infrastructure is required to provide ventilation, watering and dewatering, to ensure the safety of miners, and to ensure successful extraction. Tanzanite is mined and made ready for the market in a long and complex process.

Initially, tanzanite was easily collected from the surface, but scavenging mining didn't last long and pits and tunnels quickly took preference. Geological testing has shown that tanzanite layers exist down to 200 meters below the ground. As mining levels drop deeper, increasingly sophisticated infrastructure is required to access the tanzanite.

Tanzanite is a relatively abundant gemstone. Based on a study conducted by TanzaniteOne Mining Ltd in 2012, 270 million carats are mined per year, which equates to 54 tonnes. The current projections suggest the mines will continue to produce gem quality material at the same rate for another 23 years, providing they can progressively dig deeper

Rarity. As a sole source gemstone, Tanzanite is much defined by its genuine rarity as its beauty. Tanzanite production is decreasing with the Tanzanite Foundation stating in August 2013 that, "At the current rate of mining, and given its single source and limited supply, it is estimated that there is less than 15 - 20 more years of Tanzanite left in the ground".

Shrinkage stoping refers to any overhand method in which the stope is kept full of broken ore until it is completed. The miners stand on top of the broken ore and work at the back. As broken ore takes up more space than ore in a solid mass, about 35 to 40 per cent, of it must be drawn to leave room for working.
