## Properties of Concrete by Replacement of Natural Sand with Artificial Sand
The advantage of natural sand is that the particles are cubical or rounded with smooth surface texture. The grading of natural sand is always not ideal. It depends upon place to place. Being cubical, rounded and smooth textured, it gives good workability. One of the important ingredients of conventional concrete is natural sand or river sand.
