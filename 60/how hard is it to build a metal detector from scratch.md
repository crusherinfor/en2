Our latest detector weighs 68 g (the model in our 2016 paper was about 10 times as heavy), draws less than a watt of power, and has an improved low-signal response. The design is so simple that it should take students just a few hours to build a full detector from scratch. The detector is starting to gain international interest.

## How to Build a Metal Detector Circuit - Learning about Electronics
Once metal is placed near the inductor L1, it will trigger current production from the proximity detector IC, which in turn lights the LED. So to test this circuit, just place a metallic object near this inductor. When done, the LED should turn on. When the metallic object is moved away, the LED should shut off.
