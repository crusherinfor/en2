## What is Portland cement process of Manufacturing,Dry and Wet
The process of manufacture of cement consists of grinding the raw materials, mixing them and then burning them in a kiln at a temperature of about 1300 o C to 1500 o C at, which temperature, the material sinters and partially fused to form nodular shaped clinker. The clinker cool sinters and partially fuses to form a nodular shaped clinker.
