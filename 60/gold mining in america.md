## Organized Crime and Illegally Mined Gold in Latin America
In the first decade of the 21st century, two trends intersected: soaring gold prices greatly increased the profitability of gold mining, whilst the US led "War on Drugs", notably in Colombia and Mexico ('Plan Colombia' and the 'MÃ©rida Initiative'), sharply reduced the profitability of drug trafficking from Latin America to the USA.

## Gold Panning -History of a Prospecting Method (Tool)
There is a very long history of gold panning and gold placer mining in North America. The low cost of panning and its simple process allowed for many men of very modest means to join the gold rushes in North America in the 19th century. The first major rush in North America occurred from 1848 and 1855 in north central California.
