## Gold processing 101 - Mining Magazine
Metallurgical processing of metalliferous ores in general and gold ores in particular, consists essentially of three stages, often colloquially referred to as: Bashing (crushing); Mashing (grinding); and. Hashing (extraction/recovery) In the context of flowsheet selection, the bashing and mashing stages are relatively straightforward.

## Gold: History of Use, Mining, Prospecting, Assay & Production - Geology
Extraction of gold and other precious metals from their ores by treatment with mercury is called amalgamation. Gold dissolves in aqua regia, a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids, and in sodium or potassium cyanide. The latter solvent is the basis for the cyanide process that is used to recover gold from low-grade ore.

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining. Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.  It is particularly appropriate for low grade gold and silver ore processing (e.g. less than 5 ppm gold) but its use is not restricted to such ores.

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

## Gold extraction
While the romantic picture of gold mining focuses on nuggets, the reality is that gold is typically recovered from ores containing >10 ppm of the metal.  Scotland, developed the MacArthur-Forrest Process for the extraction of gold ores. By suspending the crushed ore in a cyanide solution, up to 96 percent gold was extracted. The process was

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below). These heaps can be
