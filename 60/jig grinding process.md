## Optimize Grinding Processes with Proper Truing and Dressing Tools
Truing operations deal with the form or profile of the grinding wheel. When truing a new abrasive wheel, the grinding face is altered to allow the abrasive product to do what it needs to do. Routine truing during the grinding process corrects the wheel profile and compensates for form loss as the wheel breaks down under regular use.
