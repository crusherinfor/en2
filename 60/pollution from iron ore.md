## Iron is a stormwater pollutant and requires treatment
Iron is a white silvery metal that oxidizes quickly when coming into contact with water and oxygen. It is the fourth most abundant element in the earth's crust, making up about 5% of its mass. It is soft, malleable, and strongly magnetic. Within humans and all other animals, iron plays a crucial role of carrying oxygen within the blood in the

## Steel production & environmental impact - GreenSpec
Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes. The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 92-94% iron and 3-5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.  Coke production is one of the major pollution sources from steel production. Air emissions such as coke oven
