## How To Extract Gold From Rock
Extracting Gold from Rocks! Take the rocks you want to crush and put them into a container. Use a metal one because of the force involved in the process. Any other type will give easily under the pressure of breaking the rocks. However, choose a container you are willing to dispose of. This is because it is not coming back to you in one piece.

In generals, the concentration of gold includes three stages: roughing, cleaning and scavenging. The reason of concentration is to separate the raw material into two products, concentrate and tails. Ideally, in free gold recovery, all the gold will be in the concentrate and the other part will be in the tails.

Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander. Because gold is heavy, it will sink to the bottom of the mining pan even while it's submerged in water, while the other minerals wash away. Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.

The amalgamation. So how do you use mercury to extract the gold from gold-bearing rock? When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury.

To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.
