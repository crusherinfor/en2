This early mining was highly manual. Pundalik Naik's Acchev ("The Upheaval") describes this period very well. Mining used pickaxes and shovels.

## Existing and New Processes for Beneficiation of Indian Iron ores
Besides that, the document "Vision 2020" published by Indian Bureau of Mines has stated that the threshold of iron ore mining is 45% Fe. Accordingly, iron ores with minimum 45% Fe cannot be rejected or dumped by any means. As the cutoff grade of iron ore is reduced to 45% Fe, the availability of iron ore resources has increased substantially.
