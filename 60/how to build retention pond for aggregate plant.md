Collect soil samples from several holes in the vicinity of the pond site. Make sure to dig beneath the dark black topsoil and collect your samples from the subsoil. Mix a handful of soil from each hole in a quart-size Mason jar. Fill the jar with water to within 2 inches of the top and shake vigorously for about 60 seconds.

Growing communities are at increased risk of flooding and erosion damage from excess stormwater runoff. Retention ponds are permanent structures designed to hold water flow for a short period of time, similar to a dam.
