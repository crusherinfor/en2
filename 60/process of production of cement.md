## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.

These compounds are also known as Bogue Compounds. When water is added to cement a chemical reaction between water and cement takes place leading to the evolution of heat. This is called hydration of cement. The product formed is C-S-H gel. The heat liberated during this reaction is called the heat of hydration.
