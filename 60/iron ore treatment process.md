## Copperbookdate
Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon content (less than 0.08%) in contrast to that of cast iron (2.1% to 4%). It is a semi-fused mass of iron with fibrous slag inclusions (up to 2% by weight), which gives it a "grain" resembling wood that is visible when it is etched, rusted, or bent to the point of failure..

Iron ore must go through a lengthy pre-processing stage before it can be pelletized - a series of steps that work to beneficiate and concentrate low-grade ores. This process varies depending on the ore source, but typically involves various stages of crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the iron ore.

Iron in the presence of moisture combines with the oxygen from the air to form a brown coloured chemical substance called rust (iron oxide). Rusting is a part of corrosion and is a chemical process that results in the formation of red or orange coating on the surface of metals.

Process of Steel-making from Iron Ore. Steel is an alloy consisting mainly of iron, carbon and other elements. According to its carbon content, iron can be divided into pig iron and wrought iron. Pig iron contains between 2.11 and 4.5 percent carbon, wrought iron less than 0.0218 percent and steel between (0.0218 and 2.11 percent).

## Archaeometallurgical slag
The ores used in ancient smelting processes were rarely pure metal compounds. Impurities were removed from the ore through the process of slagging, which involves adding heat and chemicals. Slag is the material in which the impurities from ores (known as gangue), as well as furnace lining and charcoal ash, collect. The study of slag can reveal information about the smelting process used at the
