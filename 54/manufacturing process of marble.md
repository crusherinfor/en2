## The making of glass fiber | CompositesWorld
The glass fiber process. Textile-grade glass fibers are made from silica (SiO 2) sand, which melts at 1720°C/3128°F.SiO 2 is also the basic element in quartz, a naturally occurring rock. Quartz, however, is crystalline (rigid, highly ordered atomic structure) and is 99% or more SiO 2.If SiO 2 is heated above 1200°C/2192°F then cooled ambiently, it crystallizes and becomes quartz.

QUARTZITE COUNTERTOPS & SLABS Quartzite is a very hard metamorphic rock that originated as sandstone. Through a process of high heating and pressurization sandstone is transformed into Quartzite, an extremely strong and durable natural stone. When heated, individual quartz pieces recrystallize giving it a beautiful and decorative sparkling pattern.
