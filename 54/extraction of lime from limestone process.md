## Lime and its Production
Lime burning. Limestone (Calcium Carbonate - CaCO3) is burnt in a kiln giving off Carbon Dioxide (CO2) gas and forming Calcium Oxide (CaO) which is commonly known as Quicklime or Lumplime. It needs to be burnt at 900Â°C to ensure a good material is produced. The temperature at which it is burnt will affect its reactivity in all other stages

## Lime in Flotation and Recovery Processes | Graymont
Lime is used extensively in the recovery of gold and silver. Ores, either run-of-mine, milled, autoclaved or roasted, are combined with lime and a cyanide solution. The cyanide dissolves the gold and silver. Lime maintains proper pH in the cyanide solution, keeping it in the liquid phase and preventing the formation of hydrogen cyanide gas and its loss into the atmosphere.
