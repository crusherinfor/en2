## How Is Oil And Coal Formed - Realonomics
Both coal and oil are fossil fuels. That means they're formed from organic matter - stuff that was alive on Earth millions of years ago - that was covered by heavy layers of rock. Over time the increased pressures and heat resulting from the overlying rock transformed the decomposed matter to coal or oil.

Where is lignite formed? Lignite, generally yellow to dark brown or rarely black coal that formed from peat at shallow depths and temperatures lower than 100 °C (212 °F).It is the first product of coalification and is intermediate between peat and subbituminous coal according to the coal classification used in the United States and Canada.

Please note that Coal is also known from an era where there were no land plants such as from Precambrian strata. This coal is presumed to have originated from residues of algae.

How coal was formed. Coal was formed in Paleolithic era ecosystems ( lake basins, river deltas or low lying areas ) and is made of the material of prehistoric plants. Initially, through solar energy they produced hydrocarbons from air, water and mineral matters. Upon decay they sank into the swamps which were environments without oxygen.

## What is coal formed from?hcharge
What is coal formed form? Coal is a fossil fuel, formed from vegetation, which has been consolidated between other rock strata and altered by the combined effects of pressure and heat over millions of years to form coal seams. The energy we get from coal today comes from the energy that plants absorbed from the sun millions of years ago.

## How are the coal deposit formed? - Profound-Answers
Dec 4, 2020How is coal formed explain for Class 8? Coal was formed by the decomposition of large land plants and trees buried under the earth 300 million years ago. The slow process by which the dead plants buried deep under the earth have become coal is called Carbonisation. Since coal was formed from remains of plants therefore coal is called a fossil fuel.

Successive stages in the formation of coal. 1. Accumulation of plant remains. The initial stage in coal formation is the accumulation of large quantities of plant remains. Such accumulations result from special conditions because dead plants readily decompose when exposed to the atmosphere or other oxygen-rich environments.
