## The History of Quarrying - Rustic Stone
Mining and Quarrying in the UK for stone has been documented since the 14th century but probably dates back long before that. The UK may be small but we have some of the best stones in the world, from slate to marble. Rustic Stone uses various quarries based in the UK for its memorial plaques and house signs.. Stone is a popular choice for house signs, memorials and stone gifts because it

##  Mineral Appraisals: What is the Value of a Quarry or Mine?
Mining is usually a permitted use in the Industrial District. If zoned in the Agricultural District, a Special or Conditional Use Permit for Mining, with or without blasting, may be required. Quarrying solid rock, like limestone and granite, requires blasting, whereas mining sand and gravel generally does not.
