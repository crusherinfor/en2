## Simple Iron Ore Processing 16205
Simple Iron Ore Process. The process of making iron is simple. Iron ore is basically iron oxide. Iron is made by removing the oxygen. This leaves crude iron called pig iron. This process of removing oxygen is called smelting. Carbon is used in the reduction process, with the ore heated to a high temperature.
