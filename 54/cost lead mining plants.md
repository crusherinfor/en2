## Lead production statistics - ILA
Lead production statistics. Published by Lasker@ila-lead 27th October, 2015. Lead ores are mined at a rate close to 5 million tonnes a year and the world market for refined lead stands at about US $15 billion. While it has a high economic value, lead is relatively economical to produce. As with all metals, there are two main production routes.

## First, lithium-ion batteries are classified as hazardous waste material 
The wastage of lead material also leads to higher import bills. This issue is aggravated by the of lack data collection from manufacturers, collectors, and recyclers.. The most significant variation between lithium and lithium-ion batteries is in the cell type they use. Lithium batteries feature primary cell construction. This means that they

## Manufacturing Causes CO2 Gas: Electric vehicles are propelled by
Manufacturing Causes CO2 Gas: Electric vehicles are propelled by lithium batteries, and their manufacture generates significant CO2 emissions.Lithium batteries cost roughly 73 kg CO2-equivalent/kWh. One battery with a capacity of 40 kWh or 100 kWh emits 2920 kg and 7300 kg of CO2, respectively.. That lithium is a midwife to a low-carbon economy makes it less ugly than coal and less evil than oil.

The cost per road distance is then 0.055 x 0.85 = $0.047/km. (Some analysts account for the generated kWh rather than the whole bill thus missing a half of the cost.) Now to the Civic: At $3.50/gal price of gasoline (10 percent alcohol), generating a "dealer mileage" cost of $0.05/km. Our conclusion thus far: both cars' "mileage" cost.
