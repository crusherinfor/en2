## COMPARING THE COMPRESSIVE AND FLEXURAL STRENGTH - Modish Project
Abstract. This study tried to compare the flexural strength of concrete made with riversand and quarry dust as fine aggregate.River sand was collected from Osogbo, Osun State, replaced at 0-100% at intervals of 10% with quarry dust gotten from Wasimi, Osun State, Nigeria.Abstract Common river sand is expensive due to the excessive cost of transportation from natural sources.
