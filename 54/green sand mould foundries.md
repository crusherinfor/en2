## Sand casting
Sand casting, also known as sand molded casting, is a metal casting process characterized by using sand as the mold material. The term "sand casting" can also refer to an object produced via the sand casting process. Sand castings are produced in specialized factories called foundries.Over 60% of all metal castings are produced via sand casting process.

## Green Sand Molding | EMI White Paper Series Issue 1
Green sand foundries are not as labor intensive. One obstacle preventing foundries from moving into green sand molding is the high capital cost of even a simple mechanized plant.  As always it should be kept in mind that green sand mold quality is a function of pattern and sand quality with the third essential ingredient being high density

Composition of green sand molding mixture for iron foundries typically consists of 100 parts silica sand, 8 parts bentonite clay and other additions like carbon ( 0,3 parts ) or cereals and 3 % water content. It's called " green" because the mold strength is developed with mechanical (compression) stress; not by a chemical reaction nor heat.

This is especially critical for cast surfaces of impellers, volutes, etc., and so it is common for foundries to run all-new sand through the thermal system for this reason.

## Sand Casting Tolerances - Stainless Foundry & Engineering
Machine molding will require a minimum amount of draft. Interior surfaces in green sand molds usually require more draft than exterior surfaces. The amount of draft recommended under normal conditions is about 3/16 in. per ft (approximately 1.5°). Draft can be eliminated in some cases through special molding techniques.

AFS Publications. May 23, 2022. The green sand casting process is the most widely-used process for casting ferrous and nonferrous metals. The process has evolved from a manually intensive operation to a highly mechanized and fully automated process that can produce up to 500 molds/hour depending on complexity, size, and foundry capabilities.

## Green sand casting: How to apply on foundry casting parts processes
Summarily, the green sand mold casting process includes 4 steps as following: Firstly, loading green sand into a flask (a typical tool used to contain casting mold).; Secondly, placing the designed pattern inside and pressing it into the sand. The pattern design matchs with the final product including calculation of tolerances. A pattern can be made from any kind of material due to this method

## Green Sand: An Introduction to Its Use in Foundries
Green sand is a compound mixture used for casting of metals in foundry applications as a mould. It is 'green' not by colour, but takes the moniker due to the fact that it is not 'set' when the metal is poured into it, rather it is still in the 'green' or uncured state. The name derives from green wood, that is, wood still containing

Sand moulded casting is the simplest and most versatile casting method used to make castings. Sand is the most popular molding material due to its heat receptivity, permeability and low cost. Over 60% of metal casting is done by using sand moulds. Sand moulds are broadly classified into two Green sand moulds and Dry sand moulds.

Castings with Pattern equipment. Green Sand Molding is a process that takes sand (combined with clay and water as a binding agent) and rams or squeezes the mixture around the pattern equipment. Once the pattern is removed, the cavity is filled with molten aluminum. The heat from the aluminum will drive out the moisture that holds the mold

## Green Sand Casting | Most Commonly Used Sand Casting Process
Create shell or CO 2 cores (if needed) Pack sand against the positive pattern on both sides of the tool. Remove mold halves from the tool. Insert any cores in mold halves (creating undercuts and/or hollow features) Close mold halves on top of each other and pour metal. Shake out (off) sand from the solid metal geometry.

##  Parametric Optimization of Green Sand Moulding Process Based on Wet 
green sand mould is 25 gm/sq cm. About 50% of the defects in castings are related to the sand like mould scabbing, rattail, penetration etc [4]. Mould scab is breaking of small piece of mould at the metal mould interface and falling into the hot metal. Hence the present investigation is concentrated on optimizing
