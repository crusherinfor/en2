## What are the Types of Cement Clinker - Construction Cost
Clinker is a nodular material which is produced in the kilning stage during the production of cement. It is used as a binder in many cement products. Clinker nodules are around 3-25 mm in diameter and dark grey in colour. Limestone and clay is heated to about 1400oC-1500oC in the rotary kiln to produce clinker.

## Clinker - Cembureau
Clinker. Clinker is the backbone of cement production. It is essentially a mix of limestone and minerals that have been heated in a kiln and have been transformed by this heat. When limestone is converted to clinker, CO 2 is released (also known as process emissions). A substantial amount of heat is needed to start and sustain the chemical

The potential K 2 O content of cement clinker due to the presence of potassium compounds in the raw feed mix is substantially eliminated by introducing an active agent into the kiln along with or in conjunction with the fuel used to fire the kiln. The active agent is effective to convert K 2 O to KCl and preferably is a chlorinated organic waste product burned along with the fuel.

A further 40% of cement emissions come from burning fossil fuels to heat kilns to the high temperatures needed for this calcination process. The last 10% of emissions come from fuels needed to mine and transport the raw materials. Therefore, cement emissions depend largely on the proportion of clinker used in each tonne of cement.

2. The limestone is combined with clay, iron ore and sand. It is then ground in a crusher and fed into. 3. Next, the fine powder is heated as it passes through the Pre-Heater Tower into a large kiln. In the kiln, the powder is heated to 1500oC. This creates a new product, called clinker, which resembles pellets about the size of marbles.

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules, usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.
