Over 145 minerals contain lithium, but only five (spodumene, lepidolite, petalite, amblygonite, and eucryptite) are utilized in lithium extraction. Of those five, spodumene provides the largest proportion of all mineral-derived lithium. In 2011, spodumene yielded 12,500 tons of lithium, while the other sources provided only about 1,500 tons.

## Lithium mines in the worldawech
The leading countries with lithium reserves are Chile, Australia, Argentina, and China. Portugal also has quantities of lithium, but they are less in number as compared to the other countries. The. IE 11 is not supported. For an optimal experience visit our site on another browser.

## Lithium Mineral Flotation - Mining and Mineral Processing Equipment 
Lithium Mineral Flotation is important method for getting lithium minerals (spodumene, petalite and lepidolite) from hard-rock resources. ZJH minerals supply the whole set of equipment for Lithium Mineral Flotation, most notably for spodumene. Spodumene theoretically contains 8.03% Li2O and therefore the production of this mineral is greatly

## The mineralogy of Lithium
This table compares the known valid mineral species listed listed with Lithium and the other elements listed based on the official IMA formula. Note that unlike other sections on this page this includes non-essential elements. The first data column contains the total number of minerals listed with Lithium and the element listed for that row.
