For good separation, the density difference between the heavy minerals and the light minerals in the feedstock should be at least 1 g/cm 3 and because the separation is dependent upon size and density, spiral separators are most effective at purifying ore if its particles are of uniform size and shape A spiral separator may process a couple .

## difference between clarifier and clarriflocculator
Mar 24, 2021The main difference between a clarifier and a purifier is the presence of a dam ring in the latter. In a purifier, the interface or the line of separation between the oil and water is created using a dam ring. The position of the dam ring plays an important role in the generation of interface and thus in the clarifying process. 100 Views

What is the difference between Bagging and Boosting? At this point, we begin to deal with the main difference between the two methods. While the training stage is parallel for Bagging (i.e., each model is built independently), Boosting builds the new learner in a sequential way: In Boosting algorithms each classifier is trained on data, taking into account the previous classifiers' success.

In water treatment, a clarifier is a settling tank used to remove solid waste particles from water. When the clarifier separates the concentrated impurities, the sludge formed by the process discharges from the bottom of the tank. Before the waste water goes into the clarifier, it passes through a station called the headworks, where large.

## What is the difference between a clarifier and thickener?
The main difference between the flocculant and pool clarifier is where the clumped particles go. Clarifier keeps the bounded matter at the top of the pool to be grabbed by the pool filter. Meanwhile, pool floc snags the particles, assembles them, and then sinks them to the bottom of the surface.

The Difference Between a Clarifier and a Thickener is subtle as they will visually look the same. Fundamentally, thickeners and clarifiers are both used to settle solids which results in the separation of liquids and solids. Thickeners are used to concentrate solids, while clarifiers are used to purify liquids.

generally, uv filters that people call 'sterilizers' are of a higher wattage (40 W, 60W) compared to 'clarifiers' (which can be 5W, 9W, 18W). But this is only a very rough guideline. For example, a 25W sterilizer in a small sized pond (say 1000 gallons), will only be able to act as a clarifier in a bigger pond (for example 4000 gallons).
