## Elusive Metal-Eating Bacteria Predicted Over A Century Ago Discovered 
The bacteria were using the energy from the manganese electrons to change CO2 into usable carbon, like plants use sunlight to turn CO2 and water into sugars and oxygen during photosynthesis. This process is called chemosynthesis, and while known to occur using other metals, it's the first time we've seen cells make use of manganese in this way.
