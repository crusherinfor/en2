3. Check its level, in relation to the stones next to it. Might need to lift the stone again, and re-adjust the leveling material (stone dust). If the stone happens to be only slightly too high, like an 1/8″ of an inch or so, then you can persuade the stone to settle down a bit, using a dead blow type mallet.

## Does mortar stick to concrete?ntal
Does mortar stick better than concrete? The strength of this particular concrete is 4000 PSI (pounds per square inch) at 28 days. Mortar, which is a mixture of water, cement, and sand, has a higher water-to cement ratio than concrete. It has a thicker consistency which makes it a great adhesive and bonding agent for bricks and tiles.

We take out the crumbling rotting mortar and put new in. The type of mortar used to repair the crumbling joints is the most important factor.

We are usually able to get a pretty clean joint environment but we usually use a bonding agent just to be safe.

## Sustainable Recycling of Marble Dust as Cement Replacement in Concrete 
Various efforts were intended to understand the influence of using marble dust in concrete due to its availability and a relatively high volume of the generation that causes serious environmental problems. Previous studies have utilized marble dust as a replacement of cement, fine aggregate, or total paste in the concrete and mortar mixtures.

## What is the Difference Between Mortar and Concrete?
It is composed of a thick mixture of water, sand, and cement. The water is used to hydrate the cement and hold the mix together. The water to cement ratio is higher in mortar than in concrete in order to form its bonding element. When mixed, it is a much thicker substance than concrete, making it ideal as a glue for building materials like brick.

Remove the damaged stone by chiseling out the mortar around the stone. Angle the chisel in the direction of the damaged stone to avoid damaging others. Then pry out the stone. Using a wider cold chisel, remove as much mortar as possible from the cavity. Brush or blow out the cavity to remove loose mortar and dust (wear eye protection).

Instead of disposing them in landfills, it can be best utilized as partial replacement to sand. In crusher dust, the particles (% finer than 150 microns) are generally high, a major concern limiting its percentage replacement to minimum with sand in a concrete mix. It can be replaced to the amount 25%. Its Availability is not a concern.
