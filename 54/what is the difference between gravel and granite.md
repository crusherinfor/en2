## Quartz vs. Granite Countertops: A Complete Comparison - Kitchen Infinity
Yes, quartz does scratch more easily than granite. This is because around 6-7% of quartz is man-made polymers and resins, so the overall material is less stable and tends to be a bit more flexible than granite. When you scratch a quartz counter, the flexibility of this resin can make scratches easier to inflict.
