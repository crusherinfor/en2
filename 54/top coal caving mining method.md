## Simulation Analysis of Coal Mining with Top-Coal Caving Under Hard-and 
The top-coal falling ability is a key factor to analyze for the application of coal mining with top-coal caving.Based on a hard-and-thick strata, which acts both as the floor of the upper coal seam and as the roof of the lower coal seam, nine mining projects were put forward to examine the mining of upper and lower coal seams, and a numerical simulation was used to study in detail the

## Numerical Modelling of Stress-Strain Analysis in Underground Thick Coal 
Abstract:- Thick coal mine operations have various methods. If the thick coal seam cannot be mined by single pass longwall (SPL), then Longwall top coal caving (LTCC) method or multi slice longwall (MSL) can be employed. In Turkey, caving methods are commonly used in mining of thick coal seams as long as the roof strata are suitable for their use.

TOP CAVING. Longwall Topcoal Caving (TCC) is a method of extraction for underground mining of thick seams. It uses a longwall set-up and natural forces to aid in the winning of coal. With this method of extraction only a single longwall is developed at the foot of the seam. The control of the roof layers at the face is by means of powered supports.

## Rule-based expert system to assess caving output ratio in top coal 
Coal mining professionals in coal mining have recognized that the assessment of top coal release rate can not only improve the recovery rate of top coal, but also improve the quality of coal. But the process was often performed using a manual-based operation mode, which intensifies workload and difficulty, and is at risk of human errors. The study designs a assessment system to give the caving
