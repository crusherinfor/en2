A belt conveyor can move light loads. It is characterized by the type of conveyor belt used (material, texture, thickness, width) and by the position of the motor unit (on the end, central, left, right, underneath, etc.). Some conveyor belts are designed to withstand very high temperatures. Rigid acetal belts can carry heavier loads.

## Controlling the Speed of Conveyor Belt using Python - Raspberry Pi 3B 
The conveyor belt has enough friction between it and the rotor that it sticks to this rotor. As a rotor turns, the conveyor belt will turn as well due to the intense friction between the rotor wheel and the belt. This turning motion of the rotor causes one side of the belt to move in one direction, while the other moves in the opposite direction.
