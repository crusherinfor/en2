End of dialog window. Generally, bricks have high compressive strength in the range of 5.5 N / mm 2 to 140 N/mm 2. If the crushing strength of the bricks is less than 3.5 N/mm 2 it must not be used. A field test about strength of the bricks is to fall the brick from a height of 1 meter and it must not break in to pieces.

## what is the crushing strength of brick
The usual crushing strength of common hand molded well burnt brick is about 5 to 10 N/mm2 (50 to 100kg/cm2) varying according to the nature of preparation of the clay. Pressed and machine molded bricks made of thoroughly mixed clay are much stronger than common hand mould bricks made from carelessly prepared clay.

The strength of a single brick masonry unit varies widely, depending on its ingredients and manu- facturing method. Brick can have an ultimate compressive strength as low as 1,600 psi. On the other hand, some well-burned brick has compressive strength exceeding 15,000 psi. Because portland-cement-lime mortar is normally stronger than the brick
