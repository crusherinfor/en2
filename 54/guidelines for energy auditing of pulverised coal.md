## Pulverized Coal Injection - Industrial Efficiency Technology & Measures
Pulverized Coal Injection (PCI) is a process that involves blowing large volumes of fine coal granules into the BF. This provides a supplemental carbon source to speed up the production of metallic iron, reducing the need for coke production. As a result energy use and emissions can be reduced. However, as coke provides physical support and gas permeability in the BF, its complete

##  Understanding pulverised coal, biomass and waste combustion - USEA
2.1 Understanding pulverised coal combustion In his review on Understanding pulverised coal combustion Morrison (1986) reviewed the then current state of knowledge with respect to coal structure, and the species involved in coal combustion and their interactions. He concluded that the overriding characteristic of pulverised coal combustion is

## Pulverized Coal System Advantages and Disadvantages - Melezy
Disadvantages of pulverized coal firing. (1) The capital cost is high as it requires many additional equipment compared to stoker firing. (2) Its operation cost is high compared to stoker firing. (3) Lot of fly ash in the exhaust which makes the removing of fine dust uneconomical. (4) Since coal will burn like a gas, there will always be danger
