Limestone quarrying began in the early 1800's and continues today. Small amounts of impure limestone have been quarried in many parts of the state, but the only place that has produced a significant amount of lime is the Rockland-Thomaston area. The "limestone" there is a metamorphosed coarse-grained marble, some of which is quite pure.

Machine Quarrying of Stones. Machine quarrying is done by using channeling machines in the site. This type of machine is driven by steam, compressed air or electricity. A groove is made using this machine around the rock and the horizontal holes are drilled underneath the block. Hence, the block gets separated from its bed.

It is noted that quarrying activities have adversely affected the forests, wild life sanctuaries, water courses and communities. The minerals that are quarried are primarily sedimentary in origin. Blue coloured limestone and sharp sand and gravel of various grades are quarried in the Northern Range for use in the construction industry.

In these conditions, the number of core holes will have to increase to define the areas of quality limestone and the geologic structures, and to determine the "mineability" of the deposit. These types of limestone deposits are normally only mined by open pit quarrying. Underground mining is usually too difficult to mine safely.
