## The Himalayas - Environmental problems - Quarrying and landslides
Quarrying Communities in the remote areas of the Himalayas build houses and hutments of stones that are quarried from the nearby mountainsides. This is a common practise in the barren cold desert areas. Quarrying also affects the environment adversely in many ways. By quarrying a lot of land is lost that could have been put to other uses.
