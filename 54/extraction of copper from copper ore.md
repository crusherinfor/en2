Then blister copper is electrolytically refined to get 99.95% to 99.99% pure copper metal. - Therefore, in the extraction of copper from its sulphide ore, the metal is finally obtained by the reduction of cuprous oxide with copper (I) sulphide. - Therefore, the correct answer is option (A). Note: Remember, in the extraction of copper, there are

## Copper extraction - Academic Kids
Currently, the most common source of copper ore is the mineral chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), which accounts for about 50% of copper production.The focus of this article is on the process of copper extraction from chalcopyrite ore into pure metal. Processes for other minerals are mentioned. For economic and environmental reasons, many of the byproducts of extraction are reclaimed.

## USB2 - Process for the extraction of copper from a sulphide 
A process for the extraction of copper from a sulphide ore or concentrate comprises the steps of subjecting the ore or concentrate to pressure oxidation in the presence of oxygen and an acidic solution containing halide and sulphate ions to obtain a resulting pressure oxidation slurry. The slurry is subjected to a liquid/solid separation step to obtain a resulting pressure oxidation filtrate

## Why the Extraction of Copper from Chalcopyrite is so difficult?
So, extraction of Copper from it becomes very difficult & it is a lengthy process because-. (i) It contains many impurities in such a high amount that the percentage of Copper in it becomes only 2-3%. (ii) Copper has more affinity to sulphur than Fe. So, the Cu 2 O formed through roasting of the ore is later converted into Cu 2 S by reacting

## Extraction of copper from complex carbonaceous sulfide ore by direct 
Nov 1, 2021A gradual increase in copper extraction was noted when the temperature was increased from 100 to 160 °C, during which a temperature increase of 20 °C, accordingly yielded an increase of about 20% in copper extraction. However, a further increase in temperature to 180 °C, did not yield a significant improvement in copper dissolution.

## In the extraction of copper from its sulphide ore, the metal is finally 
In the extraction of copper from its sulphide ore, when ore is subjected to roasting, some of it is oxidised to Cu 2 O which reacts with the remaining Cu 2 S (sulphide ore) to give copper metal. Cu 2 S +2Cu 2 O → 6Cu +SO 2 ↑ In this process, Cu 2 S behaves as reducing agent.
