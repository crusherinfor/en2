## Iron ore beneficiation plant
Iron ore beneficiation process. Almost all of the iron ore that is mined is used for making steel. So we need the extraction of a pure metal from its ore. The extract the metal from ores, several physical and chemical methods are used. The method used depending upon chemical properties and nature of the ore from which it is to be extracted.

Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## Why Is Iron Ore Valuable? Behind the Scenes of Production (+ Top Uses 
Feb 3, 2022Iron ore is a rock from which the metal iron is extracted. About 98% of the world's iron is used to produce steel. Pure iron is an element and a soft grayish-white metal. Other than meteorites that fall from the sky, iron is never found by itself in nature. Most iron is part of minerals that contain other elements.

Beneficiation. In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step

## Mining Chemicals Handbook Chapter 6 | PDF | Minerals | Mineralogy
Some examples of why detailed mineral information is important to ore beneficiation are:  Some 330 minerals are more or less opaque and can be studied to advantage under an ore microscope. Of these,  Chromite FeCr2O4 5.5 4.5-4.8 Met to Iron-black to brownish black submet. Copper Cu 2.5-3 8.95 Met Light coppery pink,

## Beneficiation of Iron Ore - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The iron ore beneficiation flowsheet presented is typical of the large tonnage magnetic taconite operations. Multi-parallel circuits are necessary, but for purposes of illustration and description a single circuit is shown and described.  A further advantage offered by flotation is the possibility of initially grinding coarser and producing
