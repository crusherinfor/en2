## Which rocks contain metallic flakes resembling silver and gold?
Re: Which rocks contain metallic flakes resembling silver and gold? « Reply #1 on: 29/07/2017 18:38:42 ». The most likely candidate for the silver and gold flakes are iron sulphides - also known as iron pyrites or, "fools gold". Lead sulphide (galena) also produces silvery inclusions that would fit the bill with what you describe.

One way is to use a magnet. If the magnet sticks to the rock, there is likely some gold in it. Another way is to use an acid test. If the acid turns black when it comes in contact with the rock, there is gold in it. Finally, you can use a metal detector to see if there are any metallic minerals in the rock.
