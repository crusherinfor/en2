Fig. 4 illustrates the flow pattern between an anode and a cathode in the middle of the cell. This figure shows an up-flow near the anode caused by the generated oxygen bubbles that rise quickly and drag liquid upward, as well as an up-flow near the cathode as a result of copper depletion near the cathode, copper concentration gradients and by the associated natural convection buoyancy.
