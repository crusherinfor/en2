In India coal seams with inclination as steep as 1 in 3 have been worked by mechanised opencast mining methods in Karanpura field. Seams at shallow depths which are actively gassy, liable to spontaneous heating or with bad roof should preferably be extracted by quarrying as the mining legislation for underground working of such seams is stringent.
