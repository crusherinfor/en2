In 2019, prices of pure Iron were at around 0.0675 $/kg. Nowadays, the industrial production of iron or steel consists of two main stages. In the first stage, iron ore is reduced with coke in a blast furnace, and the molten metal is separated from gross impurities such as silicate minerals. This stage yields an alloy — pig iron.

## How steel is produced from iron ore and carbon studied
Transcript. NARRATOR: An important use of iron ore is the production of steel. Iron alone is too soft to be of structural value, but, when combined with less than 2 percent carbon at a very high temperature, it creates the alloy steel. Steel is a strong, hard material with valuable mechanical properties. It is the most widely used structural

## While there may be a small drop in
While there may be a small drop in price, we expect the price of steel overall to remain flat into the 2nd quarter of 2022 based on the state of the steel market today. This is because there is still a strain on steel supply on a global level. As imported steel is starting to come into the US more, it will help with the overall steel shortage.
