The Process of Producing Electricity with Coal. Here is the process of electricity generation from it. Step 1. A machine that has pulverizer grinds the coal to convert it into a powder. Step 2. Furthermore, the next step is mixing this powder with the hot air. This mixing with hot air ensures efficient burning.

The use of coal is not sustainable as coal is a non-renewable energy source. The use of coal has serious negative environmental impacts. Burning coal releases greenhouse gases which build up in the atmosphere. This contributes to the formation of acid rain and the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming.

Coal is converted into electricity through a complex process that involves steaming, grinding, processing and distribution. The act of transforming coal into electricity is quite a production; coal is first ground to a fine chalky powder and added to combustion chambers of boilers before being burned at higher temperatures to produce hot gas and heat energy. Eventually, coal is sent to a

How is coal made out of wood? Coal is a rock you dig out of the ground (that much I knew). Charcoal is a man-made product and it's made from wood. You make charcoal by heating wood to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen. . The results is that the wood partially combusts removing water and impurities and leaving behind mostly pure carbon.
