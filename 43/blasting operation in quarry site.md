## Quarry drill and blast: a vital first operation
As quarry operations are essentially a process of converting solid rock into smaller particles of a desired fragmentation distribution, this comminution process is essentially achieved by the application of energy in one form or another, say Ricardo Chavez, EPC-France and Rob Farnfield, EPC-UK.

## P&Q University Lesson 4- Drilling & Blasting : Pit & Quarry
The initial production steps in a quarry operation - drilling and blasting ­- can significantly impact the productivity and costs of most downstream operations, including loading, hauling, crushing and screening, and product yield - the relative volume of high-value crushed stone products versus low-value byproducts.

## Quarrying of Stones: Its Methods, Selection of Site  - CivilSeek
In such a case when it is located far away, the cost of transport of stone from the quarry to constructional sites may become too heavy. At the same time, a quarry must not be located very close to a town because quarrying operations are full of hazards. This becomes especially important when blasting method has to be used for quarrying of stones.

## Quarry Site Best Practices - Natural Stone Council
Quarry locations are determined by the location of geologic deposits. This can result in quarry sites that are established close to human habitation, or development may occur after establishment of the quarry site. Blasting, cutting, and truck traffic contribute to noise, vibration, and dust that may impact local residents.

Currently, the quarry has over 100 trucks delivering rock to site on a daily basis. Although the journey to site is only 50km, it is arduous, utilizing a road system hardly designed or adequate for such deliveries. One-way trips can take up to 2h to negotiate and the quarry always has a few trucks in reserve to cope with the expected breakdowns.
