Dimension stone is quarried by cutting, or separating by some other means, large blocks of stone from the natural rock mass. The size of individual block produced depends on a number of factors, including the homogeneity of the rock itself, the ability of the quarry operator to handle the rough stone, and the required end use for the stone once it has been shaped.
