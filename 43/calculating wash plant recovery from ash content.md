Ash analysis at the DESOTEC lab. Total ash is a measure of the mineral oxide content of activated carbon on a weight basis. It is measured by converting the mineral constituents into the respective oxides at 800°C. The ash is mainly composed of silica and aluminium and the amount depends on the base raw material used to produce the product.
