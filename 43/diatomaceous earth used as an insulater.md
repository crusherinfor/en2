## Why and How to Take Diatomaceous Earth (for pathogen overgrowth)
The reason is, "Diatomaceous Earth will not absorb beneficial bacteria simply due to the fact that DE has a negative charge and bad bacteria has a positive charge. DE will attract and absorb the bad bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc without harming anything good or beneficial." -diatomaceous This is documented by other sources as well. Cheers!
