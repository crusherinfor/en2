## Iron - Essential Chemical Industry
Almost 50% of all the iron produced in the world is made in China, with about 1% produced in the UK. Data from: U.S. Geological Survey, Mineral Commodity Summaries, 2016. Manufacture of iron Iron is produced by reduction of iron ore, which is often a mixture of oxides, using carbon, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen.

## Ferrous Sulfate Manufacturing Techniques & The Affinity Process
Chemical Processing. There are several methods through which ferrous sulfate can be produced: Being prepared commercially by the action of sulfuric acid on iron (1). This is the chemical reaction: Fe + H 2 SO 4 -> FeSO 4 + H 2. To clarify in plain English: combining iron with sulfuric acid creates a reaction to form ferrous sulfate and hydrogen

## Iron oxide
Iron oxides are chemical compounds composed of iron and oxygen.Several iron oxides are recognized. All are black magnetic solids. Often they are nonstoichiometric. Oxyhydroxides are a related class of compounds, perhaps the best known of which is rust.. Iron oxides and oxyhydroxides are widespread in nature and play an important role in many geological and biological processes.
