## Triple Bottom Tuesday>>> Illegal Sand Mining in South Africa
One of the main reasons for the increase of illegal sand mining activities in South Africa, is the frameworks which govern the sector. According to experts, there is a noticeable lack of necessary capacities to support compliance with regulations which protect the environment and the safety and health of people, these regulations are what would keep illegal mining activities at bay.
