## The Four Main Methods of Mining - OreFlow
Surface mining is done in five ways: Strip mining - Strip mining is the most common surface mining method used to mine coal and lignite. The process is done by removing a strip of overburden before mining a seam of mineral. Strip mining is done only when the ore body is in close proximity to the surface. Open-pit mining - Open-pit mining is

## manganese processing | Britannica
manganese processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Manganese (Mn) is a hard, silvery white metal with a melting point of 1,244 °C (2,271 °F). Ordinarily too brittle to be of structural value itself, it is an essential agent in steelmaking, in which it removes impurities such as sulfur and oxygen and adds important physical properties to the metal.
