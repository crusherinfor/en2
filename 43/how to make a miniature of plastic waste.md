## How To Start Plastic Recycling Plant - Make In Business
The major step involved in recycling is compressing and melting down of plastic in to a liquid. This is done in a way so that least pollution is generated. The next step involves filtering where waste residue is removed and higher quality of liquid is passed. The next step requires shaping up of the liquid plastic.

## Plastic To Fuel â€¢ Insteading
How Plastic Waste Is Turned Into Fuel. The technology is not overly complicated. plastics are shredded and then heated in an oxygen-free chamber (known as pyrolysis) to about 400 degrees celsius. As the plastics boil, gas is separated out and often reused to fuel the machine itself. The fuel is then distilled and filtered.
