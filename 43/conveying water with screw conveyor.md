## Conveying Water With Screw Conveyor
Screw Conveyors Siccadania. Approximately 100 years ago the first Spaans (later VTK) screw pump to convey water was manufactured. Since then, Spaans has manufactured more than 100,000 installations worldwide, conveying all kinds of products from sticky waste-water sludge to products for the food and chemical industries.

Screw conveyors are volumetric conveying devices. With each revolution of the screw, a fixed volume of material is discharged. The purpose of a screw conveyor is to transfer product from one point to the next. Screw conveyors are always control fed at the inlet by another conveyor or metering device.
