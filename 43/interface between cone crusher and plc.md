## What Are the Differences Between The 7 Types of Crushers?
A high-quality hammer crusher can keep final material 100% passing a twenty mesh, fifty to sixty percent passing a fifty-mesh screen. Crusher hammers are high chrome content. The hammer service life depends on the material you process. If you're running abrasive quartz, they'll last somewhere between one to two weeks.

A secondary cone crusher should be matched to a drive motor designed and specified for high load crushing duty. The motor specifications for top performing cone crushers are with a 1.15 Service Factor and a 200% breakdown torque. These specifications enable the crusher to operate for short periods of time at or above name plate motor power.

A Jaw crusher is used for the purpose of primary crushing. Thus the stones fed as input are of a large size. A jaw crusher is able to crush a material in the range of 125 mm to 1500 mm. A cone crusher is used for secondary crushing. The input to the cone crusher is much smaller and fragmented than that in the jaw crusher.

Purpose of Crushers. A crusher is a machine designed to reduce the size of large rocks to smaller rocks, gravel, sand, or rock dust; this is essential for efficient transport of the product via conveyors etc. Crushing is the first of many stages that lead to separation of the mineral (s) from the waste (gangue) material.

Cone crushers use compression crushing where the material is crushed by being squeezed or compressed between two crushing surfaces. Selection of the type of crusher and the crushing process for any application depends on material hardness, and density of the material, feed size, desired product size, and capacity needs; as well as initial costs

Performance Different. 1. The rotating speed of the movable cone of the gyratory crusher is low, the stroke is small. And the ore is mainly crushed and broken and bent.
