## Water Purification
In an effort to solve out the leaching difficulties, and to make catalyst recovery easier, the TiO2/CdS system has been supported onto insoluble silica particles giving Silica/TiO2/CdS systems for the first time. The silica/TiO2/CdS system showed lower efficiency than TiO2 and TiO2/CdS systems in UV regions.
