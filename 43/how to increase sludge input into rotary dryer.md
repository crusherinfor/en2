Allow the pump to run till it goes into negative pressure or vacuum. Leave the pump to run for at least 20 minutes more. You can then turn the pump off. Ensure that the unit remains as it is for the next 30 minutes. Check if the vacuum holds. If the vacuum holds, it means there is no leakage. You can turn the blue valve shut.
