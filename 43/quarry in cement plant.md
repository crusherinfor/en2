Quarrying is done through drilling and subsequently, using heavy earth moving equipment such as bulldozers, payloaders, and dumpers. The quarried raw material is then transported to the cement plant, using mechanical conveying equipment such as ropeways or belt conveyors, or by vehicles like wagons and trucks.

Mining includes "mineral milling," even if not co-located with an extraction site. A cement plant is subject to MSHA even if it ships in the limestone and other minerals that go into making the cement. Mineral milling is deemed to include the kiln, cooling and processing of clinker, and storage of finished cement. But there are limits.
