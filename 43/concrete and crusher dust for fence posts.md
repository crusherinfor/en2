Our concrete fence posts are manufactured by a leading supplier Supreme Concrete. Our high-quality concrete posts far exceed the British Standard specification with their 'Strongcast' property (BS 1722 and BS EN 12839) for crushing strength and are considerably better than wet cast posts for load and deflection which makes them the ideal post for fencing giving a long life, maintenance free fence.
