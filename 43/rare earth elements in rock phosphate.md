## Direct leaching of rare earth elements and uranium from phosphate rocks 
Phosphate rocks can contain considerable amounts of accompanying uranium and rare earth elements (REEs). Interest to extract these elements during phosphate rock processing to mineral fertilizer is given as both uranium and REEs are valuable and toxic. Recovering these elements is thus advantages from a resource conserving and environmental

INL researchers have examined a method to extract rare-earth elements from mining waste. Many of these are used in the making of critical technologies.  But large amounts of REEs exist in phosphogypsum (PG), a waste product from producing phosphoric acid from phosphate rock. The U.S. mined approximately 28 million tons of phosphate rock in 2017.

Because lithium's concentration in ore at Thacker Pass runs as low as two-tenths of one percent, producing one ton of the stuff for use by society entails strip mining and processing as much as 500 tons of earth. Over a single year, producing 60,000 tons of lithium at the site could mean digging up as much as 20 to 30 million tons of earth.

Generally, phosphate rock contains about 0.05 wt% rare earth elements (REEs) on average. And the world commercial phosphate rock production is estimated to be 250 million tons per year, that makes phosphate rock a potential new REEs resource. However, low content of REEs in phosphate rock leads to the technical challenges and cost overages, that hindered the commercial recovery of REEs.

Abstract. Phosphate rock contains traces of rare earth elements (REEs) and can be a secondary source of these critical materials as large tonnages of phosphate rock are mined annually. Attention has mostly focused on the extraction of REEs from phosphogypsum, which contains more than 70 percent of the REEs reporting to phosphate concentrate

However, low content of REEs in phosphate rock leads to the technical challenges and cost overages, that hindered the commercial recovery of REEs.

## Rare Earth Elements Distribution During Phosphoric Acid  - SpringerLink
Nov 3, 2021The wet process is the most commonly used worldwide for phosphoric acid (PA) production, in which phosphate rock (PR) is reacted with strong acid mainly sulfuric acid. This work aims on studying the rare earth elements (REEs) distribution during the production of phosphoric acid using different qualities of phosphate through various industrial technologies. At the onset of this work, the

## Rare-earth element
The rare-earth elements (REE), also called the rare-earth metals or (in context) rare-earth oxides, or the lanthanides (though yttrium and scandium are usually included as rare-earths) are a set of 17 nearly-indistinguishable lustrous silvery-white soft heavy metals. Scandium and yttrium are considered rare-earth elements because they tend to occur in the same ore deposits as the lanthanides

## Scientists Just Found A Way to Extract Rare-Earth Elements From A 
The trick is using organic acids produced by bacteria to do the hard work of extracting rare earth elements (REEs) from phosphogypsum. The researchers tried a number of bio-acid mixtures of mineral and organic acids to extract six REEs - yttrium, cerium, neodymium, samarium, europium and ytterbium. The phosphate rock waste they were working
