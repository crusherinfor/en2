## Quartz Mining and Extraction | Quartz Mining Processing - GREAT MINING
In underground mining,the quartz crystals are identified by the different mining methods like shaft and tunnel mining, roof and pillar mining and through the slope mining. For the extraction of the crystal, the rock which comprises the quartz crystal is allowed to decompose in the process of weathering.
