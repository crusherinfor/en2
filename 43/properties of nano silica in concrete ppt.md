## Industrial applications of nanotechnology
Silica (SiO2) is present in conventional concrete as part of the normal mix. However, one of the advancements made by the study of concrete at the nanoscale is that particle packing in concrete can be improved by using nano-silica which leads to a densifying of the micro and nanostructure resulting in improved mechanical properties.

Sep 22, 2020Nano concrete is a form of concrete that contains portland cement particles that are not greater than 100μm and particles of silica not greater than 500μm, which fills voids that would otherwise occur in normal concrete, thereby substantially increasing the materials strength. It is the product of high-energy mixing of sand, water and cement

Matte finishes scatter all light in random directions for a purely gloss-free finish, while satin finishes have a semi-polished surface that allows more reflection of light and a mid-sheen result. 7. Very shiny paint finishes resist the build-up of dirt and stay cleaner for longer. Low-gloss paint, however, holds dust and road grime more.

##  Study on Behaviour of Nano Concrete - Ijettcs
Balasundaram et al (2016) The influence of Nano-Silica on various properties of concrete is obtained by replacing the cement with various percentages of Nano-Silica. Nano-Silica is used as a partial replacement for cement in the range of 2.5%, 3%, and 3.5% for M25 mix. Specimens are casted using Nano-Silica concrete. Laboratory tests were
