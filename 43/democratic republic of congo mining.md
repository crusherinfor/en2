## Mining Offers Potential, and Challenges, for Congo
Mining is hugely important to the economy of the Democratic Republic of Congo. But due to a civil war and ongoing conflicts in the east of the country, the Congo's mines now produce just a fraction of their former revenue. All that could change as peace returns and more of the country falls under the control of the central government in Kinshasa.
