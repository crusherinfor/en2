## Phosphate Rock - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Rock phosphate. Rock phosphate is a naturally occurring ore of marine sedimentary origin. It may have a composition of 0-30-0, but the grade is noted as 0-3-0, since rock phosphate is sparingly soluble and little of the phosphorus is available to crops. Many of the mines that produced rock phosphate are closed, and most of the marketed rock

Morocco remains the largest exporter of phosphate. However, the high cost of mining and threats of war has derailed the production of phosphate in the country. Chin is a distant second with 5% of the total reserves, translating to approximately 3.1 billion tons. However, China remains the largest producer of phosphate at 138 million metric tons.

The organic components must be combusted in order to produce an upgraded/purified form of phosphate ore. Rotary kilns can be used to decompose and remove organic materials such as kerogen found with phosphate rock. This process is often referred to as calcination, though it does not meet the technical definition of the term.
