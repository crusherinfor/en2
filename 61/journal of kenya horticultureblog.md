Bee Farming in Kenya - Honey Harvesting. A 2007 study in northern Kenya found that honey production is expanding in Kenya, but data on production trends, processing and marketing is fragmented. Annual production is estimated at 700 metric tonnes. The arid and semi-arid lands yield only crudely processed honey for urban markets.

In Kenya, large-scale export-oriented horticulture farms, cultivating fruits, flowers and vegetables, were by and large established in the 1980s. In Laikipia County, the farms have grown to be the most important employers tying the region into global markets.
