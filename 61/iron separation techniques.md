## Oil-Water Separation Techniques for Bilge Water Treatment
Separation of oil by flotation occurs due to the difference in density of oil and water, where water is denser than oil, forming a scum layer on top of the water. Floatation technique can be divided into many different techniques, including electroflotation, froth flotation [ 22 ], and dissolved air flotation (DAF).

You can add to that device, or make a new device (or multiple devices) to come up with a complete protocol, or procedure, to separate the mixture of salt, sand, and iron filings. You will determine how well your method works based on the yield and purity of your results. Yield is how much of something you end up with.

## Extraction of Iron: Meaning, Purification, & Extraction Methods
Sep 27, 2021The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.
