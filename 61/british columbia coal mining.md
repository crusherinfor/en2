## Regional study of coal mine waste dumps in British Columbia, stage II 
Abstract. Open pit coal mining operations in the Rocky Mountain Region of B.C. and Alberta were studied to assess the behaviour and performance of waste rock dumps. Since 1980 there has been an increase in failures and periods of high rates of deformation corresponding to less favourable conditions and increased number of operations.
