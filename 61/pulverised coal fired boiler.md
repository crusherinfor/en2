## Preparation and utilization of pulverized coal and clean coal slurries 
The particle size range of pulverized coal is usually below 150 {mu}m; most advantages and drawbacks of this fuel stem from the fact that small particles heat up rapidly,  But the ignition of coal-fired boilers stabilizing combustion under low load also need a large amount of oil. Information show that it will consume 5t for a 50MW unit

In conventional coal-fired plants coal is first pulverised into a fine powder and then combusted at temperatures of between 1300 and 1700 o C. This process heats water in tubes in the boiler so that it becomes steam at a pressure of around 180 bar and a temperature of 540 o C.
