Once the clinkers are cooled, they are ground to a powdered form in tube mills. At this stage, a minuscule quantity (2-3%) of gypsum is added to the mix to coat the cement particles and retard the setting of cement. The desired cement powder is ready and is finally packed and transported. Fig.: Rotary kiln.

CONCLUSION: The manufacturing of Portland cement required a sequence of process. Roughly, we can convenient the process into 4 main steps : raw material acquisition, rawmix/ clink feed preparation, pyroprocessing, and grinding mill. Comparing the wet process and dry process, dry process is more thermally efficient and save cost. THE END

The first step at the canola oil manufacturing plant is the pre-treatment of the rapeseed. The seeds initially need to be cleaned. The seeds initially need to be cleaned. Magnets are used to remove any metals, and impurities in the rapeseed can impede the extraction process when obtaining the canola oil, so they are screened and removed.
