The average grade of copper ore mined has declined by 1.8% per year over the past 12 years to 0.59% in 2017. The fall is due to declining grades at some of the largest, long-life mines and the development of new low-grade mines. The declining grade trend will continue because of the same two factors.

The technology leaches 97-99 percent copper directly on-site in six to eight hours, from concentrates as low as 5 percent copper. In gold, ROL has the potential to unlock the value of

For lower-grade deposits located near the surface, the open-pit method is the most practical for the mining of large tonnages of material. Large track-mounted drills prepare the ore for blasting, and the broken ore is hauled to the ore-dressing plant by truck (at up to 150 tons per load) or conveyor.
