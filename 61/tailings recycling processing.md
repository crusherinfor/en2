Through the recycling of tailings, an additional annual profit of 2.3 million yuan can be achieved. In the process of comprehensive recycling and utilization of pyrite-rich kaolin, due to the easy siltability of kaolin, fine and fine-grained kaolin have a great influence on the separation of pyrite flotation.

Concentration is the process of extracting the economic product from the crushed and ground ore, the waste from this process is the tailings. Froth flotation (figure 2) is the most widely used concentration method and is normally the first step in the mineral processing sequence where chemical reagents are introduced (Vick 1990).

Well, how dangerous the tailings are depends on the type of tailings. In diamond mining they don't really use any chemicals (usually). You don't have to process the milled rock to extract diamonds. After grinding the rock we can just sieve out the diamonds we want. So the Kimberlite tailings, generally speaking, should just be sand and water.

What are tailings for? Tailings dams are used to store water and waste that come as by products from the mining process.It is estimated there are at least 3,500 tailings dams around the world. But as there are around 30,000 industrial mines, the number of tailings dams is likely to be much higher.

Oct 6, 2020Tailings may be dumped in or near water or transported by wind or water to contaminate the surrounding area. Mine sites typically manage tailings by constructing ponds secured by dams. However, some mining companies are figuring out ways to turn tailings to profits with novel reprocessing technologies to extract valuable metals from the waste.

## (PDF) Phosphate Amendments for the Inhibition of Acid Mine Drainage 
The aims of this paper was to evaluate the efficiency of phosphates product and by-products from the Djebel Onk mine for the control of acidic mine drainage generated by exposure of Sidi Kamber mine tailings to climatic conditions. Kinetic tests in

## Mine tailings recycling/upcycling | ArcelorMittal - LCBA Canada
By reducing the amount of tailings that needs to be stored or eliminating the need to store tailings entirely through recycling or upcycling of tailings, the risk associated with tailings storage facilities can be reduced or eliminated.  avoid or minimize secondary processing of the tailings. produce high value recycled or upcycled products.

## Recycling Mine Tailings for a Sustainable Future Built Environment 
Apr 30, 20212 Mine Tailings. The mining operations lead to a production of 20-25 billion tonnes of solid wastes every year, of which mine tailings constitute about 5-7 billion tonnes. [ 4 ]. These tailings are generally disposed, either by direct disposal of tailings in rivers, seas or disposal in form of slurry (25-30% solid) into a cell
