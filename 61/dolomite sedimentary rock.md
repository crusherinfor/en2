2. Chemical Sedimentary Rocks. Chemical sedimentary rocks are formed when the water components evaporate, leaving dissolved minerals behind. Sedimentary rocks of these kinds are very common in arid lands such as the deposits of salts and gypsum. Examples include rock salt, dolomites, flint, iron ore, chert, and some limestone. 3.

Sedimentary Rock # 7. Dolomite: Dolomite shares the same name as the mineral dolomite of which it is mainly composed. It is practically a mono mineral rock. It consists of at least 50 per cent of the mineral dolomite. Where there are also lime or clay constituents there is every transition to limestone or marl.

The clastic sedimentary texture is also characterized by the packing of the grains, porosity, and rock hardness. This packing of grains procedure applies only to poorly sorted sediments where the finer clasts form a matrix around the coarser ones.

## Dolomite (rock)
Dolomite (also known as dolomite rock, dolostone or dolomitic rock) is a sedimentary carbonate rock that contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite, CaMg (CO 3) 2. It occurs widely, often in association with limestone and evaporites, though it is less abundant than limestone and rare in Cenozoic rock beds (beds less than about 66

## The Dolomite Problem - Electric Universe Geology
The Dolomite Problem. The question of how the mineral dolomite, occurring in sedimentary rocks throughout the Earth, was created in large quantities has concerned the geology for over 200 years now - with only moderate success in explaining it. Dolomite was identified in 1791 by the French mineralogist Déodat de Dolomieu ().

## Rocks and Minerals | Indiana Geological & Water Survey
Indiana is best known for fine examples of the minerals calcite, dolomite, quartz, pyrite, fluorite, and celestite. Scientists can distinguish more than 4,000 different minerals but many are very rare. About 200 minerals make up the bulk of most rocks. The feldspar mineral family is the most abundant. Quartz, calcite, and clay minerals are also

## Is dolostone a chemical sedimentary rock? Explained by FAQ Blog
Dolomite rocks are important oil reservoir rocks because average dolomite has usually higher porosity than limestone.  Dolomite rock is a very common sedimentary rock, especially older carbonate rocks (formed before the Mesozoic) tend to be dolomites whereas younger carbonates are predominantly various limestones.
