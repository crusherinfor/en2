The aim of the study in this paper is to establish a prediction model of gas emission in the working face. The gas desorption variation characteristics of coal with different particle sizes were assessed using physical tests and based on the coal body of No. 2 coal seam in Wangjialing Coal Mine, Shanxi, China, to reveal the influence law of coal particle size on coal gas desorption. The gas

The distribution of coal is uneven. Most of the north plains and western parts of India are devoid of coal. This involves high transport cost to carry heavy commodities like coal over long distances. Indian coal has high ash content and low caloric value. The ash content varies from 20 to 30 percent and sometimes exceeds 40 percent.
