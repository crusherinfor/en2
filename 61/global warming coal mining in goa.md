## W.Va. and global warming: Coal wins another round - Coal Tattoo
The fact remains that to do something about global warming means that something must be done about coal's greenhouse emissions. Despite some Coal Tattoo commenters who keep saying otherwise, coal is the largest source of these emissions .Â And one 500-megawatt coal-fired power plantâ€™s greenhouse emissions are equal to that of 600,000

## Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data | US EPA
Electricity and Heat Production (25% of 2010 global greenhouse gas emissions): The burning of coal, natural gas, and oil for electricity and heat is the largest single source of global greenhouse gas emissions.; Industry (21% of 2010 global greenhouse gas emissions): Greenhouse gas emissions from industry primarily involve fossil fuels burned on site at facilities for energy.

## Mining Needs to Go Faster on Climate | BCG - BCG Global
The typical response to climate change among mining companies has been to launch initiatives to enhance energy efficiency, secure water sources, and restructure portfolios to exit commodities (most notably, coal) that negatively impact the environment. But companies that go beyond this typical response can build an uncertainty advantage.

For instance, it can be from cattle, landfill, natural gas, petroleum systems, coal mining, mobile explosion, or industrial waste process. Human Influences on Global Warming Human influence has been a very serious issue now because human do not take care the earth.

(Thermal coal differs from coking coal, which has a higher energy content and is chiefly used in metal making rather than electricity production.) Coal's principal problem is that burning it is the largest source of CO2, accounting for 14 trillion tonnes of emissions in 2016, and about 25% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, the IEA says.

## Negative Effects of Coal Mining
Coal provides 40% of the world's electricity and it produces 39% of global Carbon Dioxide emissions. It's one of the drivers of our current issue with Global Warming. It's a dirty source of fuel and it's destructive to people and the environment from the moment it is mined. The effects of mining coal on the environment

## Global Warming FAQ | Union of Concerned Scientists
This carbon overload is caused mainly when we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas or cut down and burn forests. There are many heat-trapping gases (e.g. methane and water vapor), but CO2 puts us at the greatest risk of irreversible changes if it continues to accumulate unabated in the atmosphere. There are two key reasons why.

Keeping in mind a conversion rate of 2.4 tonnes (2.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted for each tonne of coal produced), experts say that coal mined in the Hunter Valley in 2013 produced the equivalent of 348 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. According to the NSW Minerals Council, mining in the Hunter Region employs over 11,000 fulltime workers.

What we do know is that coal, when burned, has by far the biggest climate footprint of any fossil fuel, producing more carbon dioxide per unit than oil or gas. In the U.S. alone, coal produced 65% of the power sector's planet-warming emissions. The 1966 article in the Mining Congress Journal certainly raises questions about what the coal
