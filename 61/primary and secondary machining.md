## Primary vs. Secondary Sources | Difference & Examples - Scribbr
A primary source gives you direct access to the subject of your research. Secondary sources provide second-hand information and commentary from other researchers. Examples include journal articles, reviews, and academic books. A secondary source describes, interprets, or synthesizes primary sources. Primary sources are more credible as evidence

## Machining Processes: Turning, Milling, and Drilling - Trimantec
In machining, several operations occur in a planned sequence to achieve the best results. We cover three of the most common operations including turning, drilling, and milling. Machining is a very common and versatile manufacturing process. Thus, it's possible to machine various types of material using these three methods.

In general, primary processes convert raw material or scrap to a basic primary shaped and sized product. Secondary processes further improve the properties, surface quality, dimensional accuracy, tolerance, etc. Advanced processes usually (but not necessarily) manufacture desired products at one step.

## How To Match Primary & Secondary Pumps - Vacuum Science World
Factors to consider when matching primary and secondary pumps. 1. Initial pump-down time by the PP to a point where the SP 'takes over' the pumping process. This is especially important if the SP starts at the same time as the PP and a given pressure must be reached in a given time to prevent the SP from 'timing' out.

Secondary education is the next stage of formal education after primary education. Secondary education is often split up into two different sections—lower secondary education and upper secondary education. Lower secondary education follows directly after primary education and is considered the second stage of basic education, or ISCED Level 2.

## Cutting Speed, Depth of Cut, and Feed Motion in Machining Operations
Jun 6, 2022Primary Motion: Primary motion is the motion of the related part of the machining operation where the cutting speed is calculated. The material removal rate is calculated with the use of cutting speed which is a very important parameter. Feed Motion: Feed motion is the secondary motion accomplished by another part of the machinery.

The primary motion absorbs most of the power required to perform a machining operation. Primary motion has the purpose of removing the metal (chip) from the workpiece. The feed motion is a motion that may be provided to a tool or workpiece by a machine tool which, when added to the primary motion, leads to a repeated or continuous chip removal

The chip formation mechanism is investigated using in situ high-speed imaging for cutting speeds of 0.1 and 0.5 m/s. Metallographic analysis of the machining chips' free surfaces, nano-indentation across the primary shear zone (PSZ), and digital image correlation (DIC) are implemented to further investigate the chip formation mechanism.

Primary/ secondary piping is a versatile piping method that's increasingly being used as the backbone of modern multi-load/multi-temperature hydronic systems. The concept of primary/secondary (P/S) piping has been around since the mid 1950s. Until the last decade, it was used mostly for larger commercial heating and chilled water cooling systems.
