## Assessing the potential of soil carbonation and  - ScienceDirect
Considering an application rate of 50 t/ha while staying in the geographical range of already existing basalt quarries overshoots their production capacity, which would need to increase by a factor of 3 (5 t/ha) −10 (20 t/ha) to have a reasonable impact. This could be achieved either by expanding existing quarries or by creating new quarries.
