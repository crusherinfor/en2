## manufacturing process of chalk - Welcome to Tables & Thyme
Aug 09, 2014Â· Manufacturing Process: Moulds for making chalks. The process is very simple. Water is added to certain quantity of POP and then is stirred with hand or thin flat wooden stick. When POP and water is mixed well and formed paste, it is then poured in the mould carefully so that each hole gets properly filled.

## How Is Sandpaper Made? (Materials Used for Sandpaper)
Start with a coarse, thick type of paper. Apply a liquid adhesive to the surface. Using a gardening wire sifter, scatter sand over the still-wet surface of the paper. Allow the glue to set until it is no longer sticky. Cover the paper with a wooden board and clamp the paper down. Leave to set for 1-2 days.

Follow these steps to make sandpaper at home: Start with a coarse, thick type of paper. Apply a liquid adhesive to the surface. Using a gardening wire sifter, scatter sand over the still-wet surface of the paper. Allow the glue to set until it is no longer sticky. Cover the paper with a wooden board and clamp the paper down.

The Manufacturing Process. Rocks or quarry stones are blasted and subjected to a series of crushing cycles to reduce the particles to the size of naturally occurring sand. The produced sand is then sieved and washed to remove fine particles and impurities, and tested for various quality aspects before it is deemed fit as a construction aggregate.
