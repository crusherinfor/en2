## A novel conversion process for waste slag: synthesis of calcium 
The synthesis of slag-made calcium silicate hydrate (slagCS) was achieved via a facile two-step dissolution- coprecipitation procedure using HCl and NaOH, respectively. The use of concentrated protonic acid facilitated an easy dissolution of BFS, and the subsequent addition of aqueous NaOH solution at 100 °C yielded a hydrate product with

Hot metal in the transfer ladle is removed of silicon at the deSi station with O2 injection, then deslagged
