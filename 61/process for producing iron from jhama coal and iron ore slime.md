##  The Development of New Iron Making Processes - KOBELCO
Since the processes use only iron ore fines and non coking-coal, FASTMET and FASMELT are expected to be the iron making processes of the 21st century, especially with the current roaring prices for lump-ore and coking-coal. 3. ITmk3R process The ITmk3 separates "nugget iron" and slag directly from the iron ore fines and pulverized coal.

## Utilization of iron ore slime and bottom ash: An overview
The bottom ash has the potential to substitute sand as filter material. Because of this, a comparison is needed between the two materials, which are given below. The specific gravity of iron ore slime is very high (∼2.81) due to iron content, whereas it is ∼2 for bottom ash and ∼2.5-2.6 for sands.

In the Corex process around 45 % of the total energy input is used for ironmaking and the rest goes to export fuel gas. The hot metal produced has carbon and silicon contents similar to blast furnace hot metal. However, nearly all of the sulphur in the non-coking coal enters the slag and hot metal.

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
