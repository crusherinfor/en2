## How does a Lime Kiln Work - Professional Manufacturer of Mineral 
Limestone Calcination Process. To produce quicklime in lime kilns, there are mainly three processes. The first stage is preheating. The second stage is calcining. And the third stage is cooling. In the preheating stage. The feed limestone is preheated by the exhaust hot air from the lime kiln, so that partially of the limestone will be calcined.

## Vertical Integration
An incentive for vertical integration is replacement of the costs of buying and selling on the market by the costs of intra-firm transfers, with the anticipation being that the latter would ultimately be more cost effective. Vertical Integration is when a company acquires another company that operates before or after it in the supply chain.

The USDA only requires kiln-dried wood to be dried for 75 minutes at 160 degrees. It's better if the wood is dried for around 48 hours at 250 degrees. This ensures the wood is fungus, mold, and bug-free. It also gets the moisture content down to around 5%. You should ask a company how they kiln-dry their wood before you purchase from them.
