## How Is Copper Obtained - Realonomics
Copper is usually found in nature in association with sulfur. Pure copper metal is generally produced from a multistage process beginning with the mining and concentrating of low-grade ores containing copper sulfide minerals and followed by smelting and electrolytic refining to produce a pure copper cathode.

How do you separate copper sulphate and sand? Sand (SiO2) is insoluble in water whereas copper (II) sulfate is water soluble. When water is added to the mixture, the sand will not dissolve, but the copper (II) sulfate will. Then, the sand will be dried. In this way, you will separate sand from the original mixture.
