## Introduction and Types Of Thermal Power Plant
TYPES OF THERMAL POWER PLANT: 1. Condensing Type Thermal Power Plant:-In Condensing type thermal power plant, discharges exhaust steam is coming to a condenser which creates suction at very low pressure and it allows the expansion of steam in the turbine to a very low pressure.As a result, turbine's efficiency increases. This type of thermal power plant plays an important role where there is a
