## Overview of ferrous (iron) mining in Wisconsin | | Wisconsin DNR
Iron mining has more than a 150-year history in Wisconsin. By the mid-1800s there were iron mines operating in Dodge and Sauk counties, and by the turn of the century, iron was being mined in Jackson, Florence, Marinette, Iron and Ashland counties.  Because the iron ore is of lower grade than the naturally concentrated hematitic ore bodies
