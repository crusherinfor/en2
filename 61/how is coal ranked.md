Coal rank also has very little impact on slag quality. 1. Variations in coal quality can have an impact on the heating value of the syngas produced by the gasification process. However, a desired throughput can be selected and then the size and number of gasifiers can be determined with the specific range of coal types in mind. 1.

Coal Rank. Coal rank is the measure of the degree of organic metamorphism (coalification) of a coal, ranging from low-rank peat to high-rank meta-anthracite ( Table 3.1.5 ). Rank can be determined through a number of chemical and physical parameters. In general, no single parameter can be used throughout the entire rank range.

Coal is defined as having more than 50 percent by weight (or 70 percent by volume) carbonaceous matter produced by the compaction and hardening of altered plant remains—namely, peat deposits. Different varieties of coal arise because of differences in the kinds of plant material (coal type), degree of coalification (coal rank), and range of impurities (coal grade).

## What is coal? | U.S. Geological Survey
There are four major types (or "ranks") of coal. Rank refers to steps in a slow, natural process called "coalification," during which buried plant matter changes into an ever denser, drier, more carbon-rich, and harder material. The four ranks are: Anthracite: The highest rank of coal. It is a hard, brittle, and black lustrous coal

Lignite - also referred to as brown coal, is the lowest rank of coal and used almost exclusively as fuel for steam-electric power generation. Jet is a compact form of lignite that is sometimes polished and has been used as an ornamental stone since the Iron Age .
