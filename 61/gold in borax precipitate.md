Aaron Winters found borax in Death Valley in 1881. He soon sold his claims to William T. Coleman, builder of the Harmony Borax Works, where borate-bearing muds were refined until 1888. Fall (mid-October through November) is a pleasant time to visit the park- the temperature is warm, but not, you know, scorching and the park is fairly uncrowded.

## Using Borax Flux to Refine Gold - Manhattan Gold & Silver
This is because using borax as the flux reduces the melting point of all the elements in a piece of ore, including gold. While out in the field, a gold prospector can grind and wash a piece of ore, then mix it with borax in a plastic bag. The bag is then placed in a bowl or crucible and heated.
