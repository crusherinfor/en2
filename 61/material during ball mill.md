## Material Movement Inside a Ball Mill
In a ball Mill material is fed, and the product discharged, in a continuos flow. In the course of size reduction, the material moves from intet to the outlet of the mill.This motion is due to several factors. In dry grinding these are: 1: increase in bulk volume of material as it is ground to finer particle size.

## Ball Milling - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Ball milling is a way to exfoliate graphite using lateral force, as opposed to the Scotch Tape or sonication that mainly use normal force. Ball mills, like the three roll machine, are a common occurrence in industry, for the production of fine particles. During the ball milling process, there are two factors that contribute to the exfoliation.

Force analysis. The main function of the ball mill liner is to protect the mill and use the convex peak of the liner to play the ball to grind and crush the material. Therefore, the main failure mode of the liner is abrasive wear under the repeated impact of small energy. Fig. 1 shows the motion diagram of grinding ball and material.

## How to improve working efficiency of ball mill
Control Feed Size. The particle size of the material entering the ball mill is controlled between 25-15 mm (the diameter of the ball mill is different for different feed sizes). Excessive rules will cause the ball mill to have too much fine material during the grinding process and cannot achieve the friction between the material and the material.

The efficiency of grinding increases with the hold-up in the mill, until the voids between the balls are filled. Further increase in the quantity then lowers the efficiency.
