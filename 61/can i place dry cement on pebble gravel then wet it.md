## Can You Use Cement That Has Hardened In The Bag?
When the cement mix inside of the bag starts to harden, either on the outer layer or throughout, the most likely cause is that it has been exposed to moisture of some sort. Not only that, but there is most likely a perforation or tear in the bag that allowed access for the moisture. It is important to store cement mix in a dry, secure place.

A concrete mixer (often mistakenly called a cement mixer) is a device that homogeneously combines cement, aggregate such as sand or gravel, and water to form concrete. A typical concrete mixer uses a revolving drum to mix the components. Average specifications of a 400 Litre Concrete Mixer include: Capacity (unmixed): 310L. Capacity (mixed): 260L.

People often think that the terms "concrete", "mortar" and "cement" are the same, but this is not the case. Cement is an element of mortar and concrete but it's not the end result. Concrete is a combination of water, cement and materials like stone or sand. Mortar is created from sand, water, cement and normally hydrated lime.

The gravel will work into the sand, but this is not bad at all (concrete is sand, gravel and a cement, 2 out of the 3). Two factors on how long it lasts before the sand does appear on top again will depend on water content, how much gravel is laid, how thick the sand is and compaction. To start your effort, water the sand well and give it a day.

I haven't seen anybody just pour in the dry mix and walk away, but I guess if the climate is sufficiently wet and/or humid, then maybe..

With a pebbled driveway, construction is done once the rock is laid down.
