Actually much more expensive. On average HMC's cost $375K whle VMC's cost $115K. As a result, 4 times as many VMC's are sold vs HMC's every year. Since there are so many more VMC's, many fewer machinists, operators, and shop owners have experience with HMC's. BTW, for a general overview of how much cnc machines cost, see our linked

## Horizontal Milling Machines vs Vertical: The Differences Explained
Apr 28, 2021Like vertical mills, horizontal milling machines feature a rotating spindle. Still, this spindle is mounted horizontally. The cutting tools used on these machine tools are typically shorter and thicker, often similar to the grinder wheel, instead of the long, thin end mills you would see on a vertical milling machine.

## Vertical Mill vs Horizontal Mill - Difference Between Horizontal and 
Aug 20, 2021Generally, a vertical mill is cheaper in price when compared to a horizontal mill. 4. Surface finish. A horizontal milling machine offers a better surface finish. 5. Efficiency. Horizontal milling has a higher material removal rate at the same tool speed in the same amount of time. 6. Speed.

1. A cutter is mounted on the arbor. Here instead of an arbor, the cutter is mounted directly on the spindle. 2. In the Horizontal Milling machine, a cutter is fixed not moving up and down. But in Vertical Milling Machine the cutter moves up and down. 3. The spindle is horizontal and parallel to the work table.

Tool Geometry. Another difference is in the geometry of the tool. Vertical milling machines have a cylindrical tool that is both long and thin. Contrarily, horizontal machines have shorter and thicker tools that can deliver deeper cuts and deal with larger workpieces.

This makes the overall function of the horizontal milling machine stronger than the vertical milling machine. The vertical milling machine does not have this feature, and cannot process the workpiece suitable for recoil and milling. The productivity is higher than the horizontal milling machine, and the rigidity is relatively good. 3. Application.

## The Difference between a Horizontal and Vertical Milling Machine 
The only real difference comes in the cutting heads. Instead of a fixed spindle rotating vertically, horizontal mills (like our Summit® #3 Series Universal Horizontal Milling Machine) have a single horizontal arbor. This arbor (a sort of rod or shaft) is equipped with grinding wheels which frequently resemble thick saw blades.

Vertical mills are quite common in the manufacturing industry. We attribute this due to its low cost when compared to horizontal milling systems. As the name suggests, the spindle or cutting head has a vertical orientation on the vertical milling machines. On the particulars of how the milling controls work, it varies in the different machine

## Horizontal vs Vertical Milling: What's the Difference? - OneMonroe
While vertical milling machines usually have long and thin cutting tools, horizontal milling machines have shorter and thicker cutting tools. Horizontal milling machines are able to perform heavier, deeper cuts than vertical milling machines. As a result, manufacturing companies often use them to cut grooves or slots into workpieces.
