## Green sand moulding - Steps, Advantages and Disadvantages
Green sand moulds are softer than dry sand moulds. This allows greater freedom in construction when the castings solidify and cool. Green sand moulds are quite strong for small depths, as the gases escape from them. Green sand moulds do not require any backing operations or equipment, but dry sand cores are to be used.

The first step is to apply a gelcoat which will be the mold surface. The gelcoat must be "exterior gelcoat" (wax free). If many parts are to be taken off the mold, it is desirable to use a "tooling gelcoat" which is designed to give longer life in mold use. The gelcoat should be in contrasting color to the surface of the part you will make.
