## Production yield calculation formula-tec
2010. 12. 16. Â· we would like to know the correct method for calculating the yield for working the production of Sponge Iron in a rotary kiln. we have been evaluating the yield for production using the following formula: P = (Q-%TM)X (% Fe (T) in ore - % LOI - 1 / 2 % L&P) where.P = Production, Q = Qty of ore used in the Kiln.Fe (T) = Total iron in the ore,.

## Direct Reduced Iron and its Production Processes - IspatGuru
Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form. Oxygen (O2) is removed from the iron ore by chemical reactions based on H2 and CO for the production of highly metalized DRI. In the direct reduction process, the solid metallic iron (Fe) is obtained directly from solid iron ore without subjecting the ore or the metal to fusion.

DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state, i.e. without melting, as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen, coming from reformed natural gas, syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

## the process of iron ore production
May 08, 2013 Metals production is the largest industrial source of greenhouse gases, with steel the main culprit. Traditional methods of extracting iron from its ore require a carbon-based reductant and Oct 15, 1997 The present invention concerns a process for iron ore pellets production comprising at least one iron ore crushing stage in a roller press for the production of iron ore pellets.

## Direct Reduction Process - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In a DR process, iron ore pellets and/or lump iron ores are reduced by a reducing gas to produce DRI or hot briquetted iron (HBI). Depending on the generation of the reducing gas, two different DR processes are commercially available: gas-based and coal/oil-based. In the gas-based DR process, the reducing gas is produced by chemically reforming
