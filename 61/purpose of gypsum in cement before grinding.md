When gypsum is heated to approximately 128°C, most of the water of crystallization is driven off and a fine white powder is left behind—plaster of paris. When water is added to the plaster, the reaction is reversed, and the plaster recrystallizes or "sets" by incorporating water molecules into the crystalline lattice of the calcium.
