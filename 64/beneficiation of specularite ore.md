An iron ore contains specularite and hematite which are its main iron minerals and carbonates such as calcite which are its main gangue minerals. The ore is very apt to produce slime in the grinding process,leading to a deteriorated beneficiability. The rough iron concentrate can be obtained by using high gradient magnetic separator to discard tailings with the grinding fineness of 95% -0.074mm.

## beneficiation of specularite ore
Here is the specularite beneficiation equipment. Specularite iron ore presents compact crystals unevenly embedding in the ore with the coarse granules. Simple crushing can liberate the iron granules from the gangue. After screening the specularite ore can be fed into the jigging beneficiation equipment for gravity beneficiation. Read More

## Flotation separation of specularite from chlorite using propyl gallate 
1. Introduction Iron ores, such as hematite, magnetite, specularite, etc., are the basic materials of the iron and steel industries. 1,2 Due to the fast development of the economy and urbanization, the consumption of iron and steel requires more efficient separation methods to improve the grade of the ore. 3 Froth flotation has been proven to be one of the most effective processing methods for
