## Biomining: Metal Recovery from Ores with Microorganisms
An ecologically acceptable and yet economic alternative for processing of sulfidic low-grade ores, where metal sulfides cannot be concentrated economically by flotation, is the extraction of metals by means of microorganisms. This procedure is called biomining [ 18, 20 - 22, 38, 40, 124 - 127, 144, 150, 158, 179 ].

The PGM ore is initially treated in primary and secondary crushers after which it is sent to rod and ball milling circuits.  The Kell process has three stages: stage 1 is the leaching of base metal sulphides in an acidic sulphate medium (pressure oxidation); stage 2 is roasting of the residue from stage 1; and stage 3 is atmospheric leaching

## Lunar resources
Solar power, oxygen, and metals are abundant resources on the Moon. Elements known to be present on the lunar surface include, among others, hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), silicon (Si), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), aluminium (Al), manganese (Mn) and titanium (Ti). Among the more abundant are oxygen, iron and silicon. The atomic oxygen content in the regolith is estimated at 45% by weight.

The process of extracting metal ores buried deep underground is called Mining. The metal ores are found in the earth's crust in varying abundance. The extraction of metals from ores is what allows us to use the minerals in the ground! The ores are very different from the finished metals that we see in buildings and bridges.

## EXTRACTING METALS FROM SULFIDE ORES - Electrochemical Society
Many important metals are present in nature combined with sulfur as metal sulfides; these include cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, molybdenum, nickel, silver, and zinc. In addition, gold and platinum group metals are associated with sulfidic base metal ores. The extraction of metals from their ores has been an essential factor in the creation and

## stages of metal extraction from an ore
Extraction of Metals (Metallurgy) Overall Science. The extraction of the metals from the calcined or roasted ore consists of two steps i.e., removal of earthy impurities and reduction of the ore to metal. The different methods applied for carrying out the concentration of ores are useful to separate only a part of gangue and the ore
