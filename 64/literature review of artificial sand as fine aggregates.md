M. R. Chitlange in 2010 study shows that mixes with artificial sand as fine aggregate gives consistently higher strength than the mixes with natural sand. The sharp edges of the particles in artificial sand provide better bond with cement than the rounded particles of natural sand resulting in higher strength.

## Artificial Sand - What Is It and How to Make It | Fote Machinery
Artificial sand, also called crushed sand or mechanical sand (m sand), refers to rocks, mine tailings or industrial waste granules with a particle size of less than 4.75 mm. It is processed by mechanical crushing and sieving. In China, the artificial sand was mainly used in the construction of hydropower systems.

Fine aggregates have four different moisture conditions: oven-dry, air-dry, saturated-surface dry, and wet. Fine aggregate in wet conditions can hold 5% moisture. It can cause bulking problems while forming concrete. Ideally, the moisture content of sand for construction works should not be more than 5%. 3.
