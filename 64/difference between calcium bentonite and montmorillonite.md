Overview. So often when the word "desiccant" is used, people automatically think of the three main types of desiccants: Indicating Silica Gel, Molecular Sieve, and Clay desiccant. Those who have heard of other desiccants, like Calcium Oxide, Montmorillonite Clay and Calcium Sulfide, may or may not have a clear understanding of those

The Difference Between DE and Bentonite Clay, - Know More. The Difference Between DE and Bentonite Clay Despite the popularity diatomaceous earth and bentonite clay have seen in recent years, they are still shrouded in questions and uncertainty Many people still have no idea what they are, while others are familiar with one or the other, yet wonder which is better and what makes them different

## Difference Between Kaolin and Bentonite Clay
The key difference between kaolin and bentonite clay is that the kaolin clay forms as a result of weathering of aluminium silicate minerals such as feldspar whereas the bentonite clay forms from volcanic ash in the presence of water. Kaolin refers to a mineral that is rich with kaolinite. Both kaolinite and bentonite are clay types. And, both these minerals have many different applications

Calcium Bentonite has a dominant quantity of calcium in its mix of minerals. When the Bentonite has weathered to a microscopic size of 1 micron or less it is referred to as a Montmorillonite. Pascalite, Terramin, Living Clay and Fuller's Earth are Calcium Bentonites or Calcium Montmorillonites .

Besides, various veterinary doctors have noted that nearly 20% of dogs and cats fed on montmorillonite clay develop cancers. As earlier mentioned, montmorillonite clay carcinogenicity effects are similar to that of dogs and cats. Severe weakening of the immune system (immunosuppression) predisposes cats and dogs to other opportunistic infections.

Properties of Montmorillonite can vary considerably such as color, mineral content, pH, and ionic charge. Montmorillonite clay can be white, pale pink, blue, yellow, red, or green in color with shades in between. Bentonite is another name for Montmorillonite although it is calcium bentonite having different properties than sodium bentonite.

## Whats the difference between Bentonite & Kaolinite?
The properties of bentonite depend largely on its ion-exchange characteristics.  The mineral montmorillonite and minerals of the smectite group are usually highly expansive & can take on large amounts of water. Unfortunately, the term bentonite is commonly applied to any light-colored medium to high plastic clay.
