## Eliminating Copper from Gold Ore - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The Hunt method-calls for the direct treatment of the ore with a solution of potassium cyanide to which ammonium hydroxide has been added. The gold is thus extracted together with some copper, and the metals are recovered by electrolytic precipitation, the gold, silver and copper falling to the bottom of the vats as a sludge.
