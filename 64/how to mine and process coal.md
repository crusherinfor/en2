## Coal | WWF - Panda
The use of coal can be traced back to around A.D. 50 from cinders in Roman ruins in Britain. There is also evidence to suggest that the Greeks used coal as a fuel in the 4th century. However, extensive mining of coal in Britain only started in the 13th century. To find out how coal was mined in the 18th century, try this web page.

Mining & Processing. Coal in Wyoming is uncovered and removed by large machines in a process called surface mining. Before the coal can be removed from the ground, the topsoil and dirt above it is removed using scrapers. This soil is usually removed ahead of the pit and carried behind to place on top of reclaimed areas or backfill.

An Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) is water that drains out from coal deposit mining areas and has a lower pH which has been occasioned by the presence of sulphuric acid. In other words, an Acid Mine Drainage is usually acidic although not all mine drainages are acidic. This acidity is due to the high concentration of sulphuric acid.

## Drilling Methods Used in Coal Mines | Geology for Investors
Coring ( diamond drilling) is another way of collecting information about a potential coal resource. The drill rig is equipped with a hollow tube, and as the drill pushes the rods into the ground, a cylindrical piece of the rock is pushed into the hollow tube. These samples are usually the length of a drill rod, which is 6 meters.

## Coal Mining: How Is Coal Mined? - Science ABC
Jul 9, 2022Coal mining (also called colliery) is the process of extracting coal from the ground's surface or from deep underground. Coal miners literally raze entire mountain ranges to feed our insurmountable desire for cheap energy. There's something brutally simple about coal mining. Take away the monstrous-but-sophisticated machinery and eco
