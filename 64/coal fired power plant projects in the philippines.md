By the end of 2021, the U.S. is expected to burn through 588 million short tons (MMst) of coal. That's a steady 10% increase over 2020. Heading into 2022, forecasts are calling for yet another 10% jump in consumption. And nearly all of it will be headed straight into power plants to stockpile against the coming winter.

## Is there a power plant in the Philippines?
What is the common power plant in the Philippines? Coal power plants generated 46.8 million MWh in 2017, making up half of the country's power generation mix. Renewable energy and natural gas power plants followed with respective shares of 24.6% and 21.8% to the country's gross power generation. Oil-based power plants contributed the least, at 4%.

## Under-constructi­on generating facilities still mostly coal-fired
COAL FACILITIES made up just over half of power plants under constructi­on in the period, the Department of Energy (DoE) said. The capacity of plants being built, which the DoE calls "committed power projects," amounted as of July to 8,864.29 megawatts (MW), with coal facilities accounting for 50.63% or 4,488.40 MW.

## How many coal-fired power plants are there in the Philippines?
The Philippines' energy department says it will issue a moratorium on new coal-fired power plants, but will allow projects that have already been approved to be built. Coal accounts for nearly half of the Philippines' energy mix, and is expected to increase to 53% by 2030, when the 22 proposed plants that have already been approved come online.
