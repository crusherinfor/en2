## Is pulverizing a chemical change?
What kind of reaction is the detonation of nitroglycerin? It is the speed of the decomposition reaction which makes nitroglycerin such a violent explosive. Unlike burning, which can only travel as fast as the flame front can move through the material, high explosives are decomposed almost instantaneously by a supersonic shock wave passing through the material.

## The Most Useful Metals For High-Temperature Applications
High-temperature resistance metals are designed for applications where temperature is sufficient to melt regular-grade materials. Almost all metals that are able to withstand temperatures of 500℃ and above are high-temperature alloys. These materials are a combination of metals and additional elements that are selected for specific property traits, which in this case is heat resistance.

## Development of High Temperature Oxidation Resistant Iron-Based Heat 
Fe-Mn-C alloy did not show sufficient oxidation resistance at high temperature, whereas the aluminized sample showed a superior oxidation resistance due to the formation of continuous Al2O3 layer. Thinner Al2O3 layer is formed on the alloy sample by the aluminizing with lower Al concentration and shorter time and its latent heat become larger.
