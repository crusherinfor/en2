##  Properties of Manganese Ores and Their Change in The Process of Calcination
In the process of calcination of manganese ores in air, MnO2 was reduced to Mn2O3 and Mn3O4, while  properties of a manganese ore have a large influence on the technology and efficiency of the production of manganese alloys. The melting and reduction behaviour of ores are defined by their chemistry, mineralogy and physical

This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150 and 250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe 2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio.
