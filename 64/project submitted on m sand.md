## Manufacturing of Bricks using Eco Sand and Foundry Sand
The properties of eco sand and foundry sand are found out by using standard test procedure. In this project different proportions of cement, eco sand, foundry sand are thoroughly mixed and moulded into bricks and the test were performed for the property of compressive strength for 7 days,14 days, 28 days of curing and 24 hours of sun drying.

## M Sand (Manufactured Sand) - A Substitute to River Sand
Overall, M Sand is 30% cheaper than the river sand. Eco-friendly: Use of M Sand in replacing with river sand avoids environmental disasters like groundwater depletion, water scarcity, a threat to natural life etc. Growing concern for environmental protection, M Sand is the best alternative to the river sand.

## Manufactured Sand (M-Sand)! Properties of M-Sand - Civil Rack
What is Manufactured Sand (M-Sand)? Manufactured sand (M-Sand) is a replacement for river sand for concrete construction. M- Sand is made by crushing hard granite. The crushed sand particles are cube-shaped with grounded edges. After cleaning and grading, they can be used as building materials. The size of the M-Sand is less than 4.75mm.
