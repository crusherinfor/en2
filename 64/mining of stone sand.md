May 24, 2021 High-temperature baked sandstone is widely distributed in the north of Shaanxi, China. The lithology of these rocks has a significant impact on the mining of underground resources such as coal. To understand changes in its physical properties after heat treatment, yellow sandstone was heated for two hour at a constant temperature

The mining of material in this quarry is usually carried out with a D9 dozer which rips the rock and crushes the large fragments with the tracks. A loader or excavator loads the crushed rock into trucks which transports the material to the on-site treatment plant.  Sandstone is a rock comprising mostly of minerals formed from sand.

## 'Over excavation of sand pose a serious environmental challenge'
In recent years in India, sand mining has becomemore widespread and mechanised. The concept of seasonal sand mining is vanishing and mining activities go on in almost every season.Many riverbeds and streambeds are completely denuded of sand, prompting construction companies to look for alternatives to sand such as stone powder.

Cobblestone is a common block, obtained from mining stone. It is mainly used for crafting or as a building block. Cobblestone can be mined using a pickaxe, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Its hardness is greater than stone so it requires more time to break, especially with anything other than a pickaxe.

Crushed stone is an angular form of construction aggregate, made by breaking quarried rock into fragments that may be sorted, sized, and recombined into a variety of products. Crushed stone is typically quarried—that is, mined using benching methods (carrying out work from a ledge in a mine or quarry) and explosives, as opposed to the mechanical digging used for extracting sand and gravel

In places such as India, for example, the mining of sand has been linked with local conflicts over access to water and water pollution. At the same time, the extraction of sand, gravel and crushed stone provides jobs for millions of people and supplies materials for the renewable energy sector as well as roads and other infrastructure.

After mining, sand and gravel may be used as is, which is called bank-run or pit-run gravel, or it may be further processed. The procedures for processing sand and gravel are similar to those for processing crushed stone. The amount of processing depends on the characteristics of the sand and gravel deposit and the intended use.
