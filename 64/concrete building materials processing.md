## Radiation Studies - CDC: Radiation from Building Materials
Building materials that are made up of sandstone, concrete, brick, natural stone, gypsum, and granite are highly unlikely to contain radioactive material that will increase radiation dose above the low levels of background radiation we receive on a daily basis. Radioactive material in building materials may add to indoor radon levels.

## Fabrication and Characterization of Cement-Based Hybrid Concrete 
Nowadays, the incorporation of natural fiber, such as coir fiber, to high-strength concrete has sparked a lot of attention in the construction materials industry. This is because coir fibers are significantly cheaper and more widely accessible than synthetic fibers. Natural fibers such as bamboo, flax, hemp, and coir have distinct microstructures and chemical compositions from cement-based

## Concrete - Energy Consumption - Green Building
Reinforced concrete is the primary structural material in China, as it is in much of the world today (Figures 5 and 6). It is also a primary material in vast expanses of exterior wall construction.Its choice is dependent on a large and inexpensive labor force, readily available quality constituent materials, and a lack of reasonable alternative materials and product diversity for construction.

The right selection of building materials plays an important role when designing a building to fall within the definition of sustainable development. One of the most commonly used construction materials is concrete. Its production causes a high energy burden on the environment. Concrete is susceptible to external factors. As a result, cracks occur in the material. Achieving its durability

## Concrete Production Process| marstllaroilconcrete
Concrete production creates fewer CO 2 emissions than other building materials do. Its long lifespan means it doesn't need to be replaced often, and it can be recycled to create new concrete when it does break down. It's an Energy Efficient Building Material; Compared to other building products, concrete has a high thermal mass.
