## How Gold Mining Can Affect Water Quality - Okanogan Highlands
A prerequisite of sustainable development must be to ensure uncontaminated streams, rivers, lakes and oceans. Mining affects fresh water through heavy use of water in processing ore, and through water pollution from discharged mine effluent and seepage from tailings and waste rock impoundments. Increasingly, human activities such as mining

Neutralization is generally the first step in treating acid mine water (gold, operational and abandoned coal mines). In Gauteng a volume of 240 Mℓ/d of acid mine water from gold mining requires treatment. At an acidity of 3 g/ℓ (as CaCO 3 ), a lime (CaO) price of R360 and a purity of 93 % the neutralization cost would amount to R57 million/a.

## How can metal mining impact the environment?
In some cases, bioavailable metals are absorbed by plants and animals, causing detrimental effects. Although current U.S. mining and reclamation practices guided by environmental regulations minimize or prevent waste rock erosion into streams, disposal of waste rock in places where it could erode into surface drainages has occurred historically.

Discoloration: If you have high iron levels in your water — usually 0.3 parts per million or more — the water may be a rusty red or brown color. Your water may still be safe to drink, but it will look less appealing. Staining: High concentrations of iron in home water will stain porcelain bathroom fixtures, laundry and dishes.

Iron in ore iron is most commonly found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite (FeO(OH)), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O)) or siderite (FeCO 3).

Many iron chelation complexes are water soluble. Usually there is a difference between water soluble Fe 2+ compounds and generally water insoluble Fe 3+ compounds. The latter are only water soluble in strongly acidic solutions, but water solubility increases when these are reduced to Fe 2+ under certain conditions.

Mine drainage is metal-rich water formed from a chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. Problems that can be associated with mine drainage include contaminated drinking water, disrupted growth and reproduction of aquatic plants and animals, and the corroding effects of the acid on parts of infrastructures such as bridges.

Mining and Water Quality - USGS. Mine drainage is formed when pyrite (an iron sulfide) is exposed and reacts with air and water to form sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can precipitate to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage.

## The side effects of lithium mining
The adverse effects of lithium mining, especially the water loss, are impacting people too. The Indigenous Aymara community lives and works around the Salar. Many grow quinoa, raise camelid livestock, and sell salt and flamingo eggs, traditional forms of income generation which, after hundreds of years, are now being compromised.

## Assessing the ecological regime and spatial spillover effects of a 
In the North China Plain, coal mining subsided lakes are surface water bodies that form after the conclusion of coal mining. In China, mining subsided lakes are often transformed into artificial wetland parks for ecological restoration.  Assessing the ecological regime and spatial spillover effects of a reclaimed mining subsided lake: A case
