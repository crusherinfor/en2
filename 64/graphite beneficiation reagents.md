## 5 Stages of Graphite Processing | Mining Pedia
The process of graphite beneficiation is mainly: crushing-grinding-separation-middling treatment-tailings treatment. 1. Crushing. The hardness of graphite ore is generally medium-hard or medium-hard to soft. The grade of the raw ore is between 2-10%, and the crushing process is relatively simple. For plants of the same scale, relatively small
