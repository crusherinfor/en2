The overall coal plant efficiency ranges from 32 % to 42 %. This is mainly dictated by the Superheat and Reheat steam temperatures and Superheat pressures. Most of the large power plants operate at steam pressures of 170 bar and 570 °C Superheat, and 570 ° C reheat temperatures. The efficiencies of these plants range from 35 % to 38 %.

## Combined cycle power plant
The thermodynamic cycle of the basic combined cycle consists of two power plant cycles. One is the Joule or Brayton cycle which is a gas turbine cycle and the other is the Rankine cycle which is a steam turbine cycle. The cycle which is the gas turbine power plant cycle is the topping cycle. It depicts the heat and work transfer process taking place in the high temperature region.

The water and air get preheated by passing the flue gas around the economizer and Preheater.

## Gas Turbine Power Plant - SlideShare
Gas Turbines • A gas turbine is a machine delivering mechanical power or thrust. It does this using a gaseous working fluid. The mechanical power generated can be used by, for example, an industrial device. • The outgoing gaseous fluid can be used to generate thrust. In the gas turbine, there is a continuous flow of the working fluid. 4.

In this paper, the steam-cooled combustor and the expansions in the gas turbines that utilize the cooling techniques for modern commercial combined cycle power plants (107H/109H GT, M501H GT, and. A schematic diagram of a gas turbine power plant is shown in the figure. It consists of a compressor, turbine, and combustion chamber. Atmospheric air is drawn into the compressor and compressed to
