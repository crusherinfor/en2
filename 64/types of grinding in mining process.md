## Grinding Machines: Types and Selection Principles - Mining-pedia
Sep 22, 2020Grinding machine has been widely used in gold mines in South Africa since 1905. At that time, the grinding machine used river pebble as the grinding medium, which was essentially a gravel mill. Later, in order to improve the production capacity of the mill, cast iron balls were used as the medium, so normal gravel mills were evolved into ball mills and rod mills.

A grinding machine or grinder is an industrial power tool that uses an abrasive wheel for cutting or removing the m aterial. It is a process of metal cutting by using a rotating abrasive whee l from the surface of the workpiece. Generally, the grinding is finishing operation to show the high surface quality, accuracy of the shape and dimension.

Grinding machine is a strong machining tool that scrapes a work piece utilizing an abrasive/grinding wheel. Abrasive wheel cover has small rough bits, which in contact with the work piece apply sheer energy that causes shear deformation. In plain terms, it alters the shape of a work piece by cutting its tiny chips.
