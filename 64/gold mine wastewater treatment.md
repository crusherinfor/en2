## Potassium Permanganate as an Alternative for Gold Mining Wastewater 
The feasibility of using potassium permanganate as a reagent for cyanide oxidation in wastewater was experimentally studied. Both artificial and production wastewater from two different gold mines were tested. The experiments had three goals: determine the optimum reagent concentration and reaction time required to achieve total cyanide removal, obtain knowledge of the reaction kinetics, and

## Wastewater Treatment for the Mining Industry | Fluence
Oct 7, 2020Fluence's innovative membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR), however, delivers a 90% aeration energy savings with passive aeration at atmospheric pressure, making domestic wastewater treatment at mining camps more sustainable. And, the process has exceptional nutrient removal due to simultaneous nitrification-denitrification.
