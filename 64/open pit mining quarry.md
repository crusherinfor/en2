## Quarry
Stone quarry is an outdated term for mining construction rocks (limestone, marble, granite, sandstone, etc.). There are open types (called quarries, or open-pit mines) and closed types (mines and caves). For thousands of years, only hand tools have been used in quarries. In the 18th century, the use of drilling and blasting operations was mastered.

## Surface Open-pit Mining - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The surface mining can be classified depending on the location of the deposit or the type of mining method. Generally speaking, we can classify surface mining in three main typologies that are open pit, open cast, and quarry. Open pit refers to the exploitation of a deposit outcropping to the surface or at shallow depths.
