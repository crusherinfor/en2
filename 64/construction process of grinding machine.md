## Machines | Free Full-Text | Research on Adaptive Control of Grinding 
The grinding force is the most sensitive physical measure of reaction loads in the grinding process. To enhance surface quality and assure high efficiency and stability of the grinding process, it is essential to accomplish adaptive control of the grinding force. This paper suggests a grinding force adaptive control system based on spindle motor power feedback, considering the process&ndash

Metal is removed from the workpiece by the mechanical action of irregularly shaped abrasive grains in all grinding operations. This article discusses three primary components of grinding wheels, namely, abrasive (the cutting tool), bond (the tool holder), and porosity or air for chip clearance and/or the introduction of coolant.
