## a machining process for metal casting - Haworth Castings
Machining essentially transforms a casting into a finished component. Turning is used to add or refine internal or external features that cannot be produced during the casting process. It can be carried out manually on lathes or using computer numerical control (CNC) machines.

## Rough Machining | BICO Steel
What Is Rough Machining? Rough machining is a process used to remove bulk amounts of excess material from a piece of steel in every pass. The goal is to quickly produce a basic shape according to a desired feature. How It Works. Rough and finish machining go hand-in-hand. Before a piece of processed steel goes through a finish pass, a rough cut is carried out to remove the maximum amount of

Jul 3, 2021Evan Doran. Associate Editor. On its surface, grinding seems simple: a machine takes a rotating tool (usually a wheel) with abrasive grains and applies it to a workpiece's surface to remove material. Each grain is its own miniature cutting tool, and as grains dull, they tear from the tool and make new, sharp grains prominent.

Casting with sand is relatively cheap, fast, and accurate enough for making machine tools and tooling. Perhaps mainly because the sand is recyclable by tossing the the broken sand molds back in the muller. After the sand has been recycled too many times it can start to make even rougher castings than fresh sand. Either way it is a trade off.
