## Dust suppression a must for quarries | Aggregates Business
Dust from quarries tends to be unavoidable, particularly when the weather is very dry. Activities, including the drilling, blasting, loading, hauling, conveying and crushing and screening of rocks all generate dust as does transporting the finished products. According to Sustainable Aggregates in the UK, predicting the level of dust emission is extremely difficult because of the complex nature

## Dust emission from crushing of hard rock aggregates
During secondary crushing, the background concentrations were achieved at a 350 m distance for coarse particles. • Dust concentrations in the limestone quarry were half of that measured in quarries processing granitic rock material. • Using the same setup, it was shown that crushing generates more dust and more coarse particles than drilling.

Silica.We've determined that one paver cut releases 45 million micrograms of dust into the air. But not all of that dust is silica.Our tests have shown an average silica content in masonry materials of +/- 20%. If 20% of that dust is silica, we can calculate silica by weight: 45,000,000  20% = 9,000,000 micrograms.

The aggregate passes through the dust control ring to catch and drop any unwanted dust created during the quick transfer. Once the material passes through the crusher, the smaller rock is either stockpiled for later use or a future transfer, or it is taken directly to another crusher for a similar process.
