These belt conveyors can be run at various inclined angles, typically between 0°- 20° (30° with cleated/chevron belting). For conveyors that operate beyond this incline, steep incline conveyors, which can operate at angles all the way up to 90°, are also available. The diagram below shows the relationship between conveyor center-to-center

## Design of Belt conveyor system - SlideShare
The diameter of the pulley must be designed such that it does not place undue stress on the belt. The length of a belt conveyor in metres is the length from the centre of pulley parallel to belt line. Belt length is dependent on both the pulley diameters and centre distances. Capacity is the product of speed and belt cross sectional area.

## Conveyor Belts - IspatGuru
Design considerations of the conveyor belt affect the power demand, belt curves, and transitions etc.  Each conveyor structure needs a belt with a specific tension rating. The strength of the belt, either carcass tension rating or ultimate breaking-strength, represents the amount of force which can be applied to the belt.

The structure accommodated a permanent, self-cleaning belt magnet system on an existing stacker conveyor. To facilitate transport and installation, we designed the structure as bolted rather than fully welded. The conveyor magnet structure was mounted on four concrete footings and secured with chemical anchors.
