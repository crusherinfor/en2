##  PROCESS DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES FOR CEMENT MILL OPTIMISATION V.K. Batra, D 
HOLTEC has undertaken Performance Optimisation of the cement grinding circuits by doing process diagnostic studies in many cement plants. The paper describes the approach for the process diagnostic study for the optimisation of a ball mill circuit and is supported with typical case study done by HOLTEC in a 1.5 mio t/a cement plant.

The last stage of making cement is the final grinding process. In the cement plant, there are rotating drums fitted with steel balls. Clinker, after being cooled, is transferred to these rotating drums and ground into such a fine powder that each pound of it contains 150 billion grains. This powder is the final product, cement.
