The high salt-alkalinity of bauxite residue (BR) hinders plant growth and revegetation of bauxite residue disposal areas (BRDA), which cause serious potential environmental and ecological risks. Bioneutralization is a promising method for improving the properties of BR and plant colonization. In the present study, a strong saline-alkali tolerant bacteria (ZH-1) was isolated from aged BR and

## Bauxite
Bauxite ore contains 30-60% aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3). In the Bayer process (Figure 2), the bauxite is digested in a pressure vessel along with a sodium hydroxide solution (caustic soda) at an elevated temperature, which dissolves the aluminum oxide converting it into sodium aluminate, leaving insoluble red mud solids as a by-product. The alumina is extracted from the bauxite by means of the

Oct 15, 2020The methods used in mining bauxite differ somewhat in different countries and with different types of deposits.

## Bauxite mining in the United States
Bauxite forms by the weathering of aluminum-rich and silica-poor rocks in hot, humid, climates, at places with good drainage. Under the proper conditions, weathering disintegrates the aluminium silicate minerals, and dissolves and removes the silica, creating bauxite. The mined US bauxite deposits have all been in the southeastern United States.

Mining Immediately prior to mining any deposit, the land is cleared and the top soil, to a minimum of 6 inches, removed and stockpiled for later replacement when mining is completed. The surface occurrence of the ore (usually less than 100 feet) makes the deposits suitable for mining by simple opencast methods.

Types of Bauxite Ore. In 1951, Vadasz classified bauxite into lateritic bauxites and karst bauxites. Lateritic bauxites-Also known as silicate bauxites, these were formed due to the lateralization of various silicate rocks such as granite, gneiss, basalt, and shale.The formation of these bauxites is heavily dependent on intense weathering conditions in a location with excellent drainage.

Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Milling: Several meters of rock and clay are removed by blasting, drilling, and bulldozers. The bauxite is then transported to the crushing and washing area, reducing the particle size and increasing the available surface area for the digestion stage.

## Bauxite Mining
Bauxite is generally extracted by open cast mining, being almost always found near the surface. Bauxite occurs mainly in tropical and sub-tropical areas, like Africa, the West Indies, South America, Australia & India there are some small deposits located in Europe. India is the Fifth largest producer of bauxite, supplying around 6 per cent of

## Water | Free Full-Text | Groundwater Defluoridation with Composite 
As a result, substituting minimally processed bauxite ore for commercial adsorbents might result in a fluoride remediation method that is (a) more effective in terms of USD/volume of water treated, (b) affordable for low-income earners, and (c) more widely available in afflicted regions . To summarize, bauxite samples have enhanced adsorption
