## Coal in South Africa
South Africa produces in excess of 255 million tonnes of coal (2011 estimate) and consumes almost three-quarters of that domestically. As of 2018, South Africa was the seventh largest producer and consumer of coal in the world. This large industry, means that as of 2015 about 80,000 workers, or .5% of total employment, was from the coal industry, down from a peak in 1981 of 135,000 workers.

Open-pit mining. Some 53% of South Africa's coal is produced from surface mining, via open-cast or open-pit mines. This is because the coal is less than 60 metres below the surface. Open-pit mines use draglines, as well as truck and shovel operations to extract coal. A dragline excavator uses a dragline to pull a bucket by a wire cable.

The South African mining industry has consistently increased the size of its workforce, from 406,994 in 2001 to 453,543 in 2018. This has led to a parallel increase in the tax paid by mining companies to the national government, from $1.21bn in 2010 to $1.56bn in 2018, according to the country's Minerals Council.
