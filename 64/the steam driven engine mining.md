Steam in the Industrial Revolution. The steam engine, either used on its own or as part of a train, is the iconic invention of the industrial revolution. Experiments in the seventeenth century turned, by the middle of the nineteenth, into a technology which powered huge factories, allowed deeper mines and moved a transport network.

## The History of the Steam Engine: Advancements, Uses - IQS Directory
The use of steam power improved mining techniques and made it possible for miners to dig deeper and extract greater quantities of coal and other ores. Initially, miners had to hand carry loads from mines, which was labor intensive and time consuming.  Historically, the introduction of the steam powered engine was the beginning of the rapid

## The Steam Engine | Environment & Society Portal
The Steam Engine. Initiated by the growing need for raw materials, the development of steam power set off a chain reaction. In order to pump pit water out of mines, steam engines were built near mining sites. Because these steam engines were powered by coal, coal mining became profitable—a mutually beneficial system.

First was the evolution of the railroad: the combination of the steam locomotive and a permanent travel way of metal rails. Experiments in this conjunction in the first quarter of the 19th century culminated in the Stockton & Darlington Railway, opened in 1825, and a further five years of experience with steam locomotives led to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which, when it opened in

The first important use of the steam engine came in 1776. The steam engine was used to show the Cornish miners how successful it could be in removing the water from the mineshafts. This proved to be of great importance to the Cornish, because one of their biggest problems was the flooding of the mining shafts.
