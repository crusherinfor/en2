Silica. We've determined that one paver cut releases 45 million micrograms of dust into the air. But not all of that dust is silica. Our tests have shown an average silica content in masonry materials of +/- 20%. If 20% of that dust is silica, we can calculate silica by weight: 45,000,000  20% = 9,000,000 micrograms.
