## The Actual Difference Between Surface and Underground Mining
Minerals Extracted. Surface mining is commonly used to extract coal and copper, and increasingly, precious metals like gold. Underground mining is used for gold, platinum, zinc, lead, and increasingly, coal. As can be seen, surface mining is much more advantageous than its counterpart. However, when an outcropping ore body stretches deep inside

## What is the difference between opencast & underground mining?
Underground mining not only produces gold, copper & silver but also precious gems like diamonds & rubies. The advantages of underground mining: • There are no damages to the surface environment or mine area. • The ground does not require blasting with explosives. • There is a higher production volume. • Cost effective than surface mining.

This article will give you a general idea of underground mining and its different methods. Open-pit mining or surface mining is one of the most common mining methods used on the earth's surface. This type of mining starts from the surface of the planet. On the other hand, Underground mining is only to extract ore from below the earth's surface.

The difference between an open pit mine and a quarry is that a quarry uses the mined product "as is" without milling and extraction, such as limestone, gypsum, bentonite, gravel etc. A mine usually refers to metals like gold or copper being recovered from ore once it has been mined.
