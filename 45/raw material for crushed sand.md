## Crushed sand
Crushed sand Is a product manufactured to replace natural sand in the future, produced by high-speed impact technology that causes the rock to break at the weakest section. This feature helps the product to always have a round shape and low friction, which increases the flexibility of the concrete, and the stable quality of concrete.

Concrete is formed when portland cement creates a paste with water that binds with sand and rock to harden.  The first step is to quarry the principal raw materials, mainly limestone, clay, and other materials. After quarrying the rock is crushed. This involves several stages. The first crushing reduces the rock to a maximum size of about 6
