## Wet Process of Cement Manufacturing - Cement Wet Process & Cement Dry 
This method is called a semi-dry process, which belongs to the cement dry process production. Advantages: as the dry process is to directly feed raw material powder into the rotary kiln for calcination, and the moisture content of raw materials is about 1% - 2%, it saves the heat consumption needed for the moisture evaporation. Therefore

## Copper Life Cycle - Copper Alliance
After mining, copper is produced by one of two process routes, pyrometallurgical (dry) or hydrometallurgical (wet). Smelting is a process of heating and melting ore to extract a metal like copper. Refining refers to any process that increases the grade or purity of the metal. After completing refining processes, copper cathode is generally 99.9

## pper ore production dry process wet process
After mining, copper is produced by one of two process routes, pyrometallurgical (dry) or hydrometallurgical (wet). Smelting is a process of heating and melting ore to extract a metal like copper. Refining refers to any process that increases the grade or purity of the metal. After completing refining processes, copper cathode is generally 99.9
