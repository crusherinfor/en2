## Data Mining - Cluster Analysis
This method locates the clusters by clustering the density function. It reflects spatial distribution of the data points. This method also provides a way to automatically determine the number of clusters based on standard statistics, taking outlier or noise into account. It therefore yields robust clustering methods.

## Positive-Unlabeled Learning for Network Link Prediction
Link prediction is an important problem in network data mining, which is dedicated to predicting the potential relationship between nodes in the network. Normally, network link prediction based on supervised classification will be trained on a dataset consisting of a set of positive samples and a set of negative samples. However, well-labeled training datasets with positive and negative

## Data Mining Techniques: Types of Data, Methods, Applications
Aug 31, 2022Data mining methods help companies determine the prices and position their products based on their customer preferences. Data mining also makes it easy for any retailer to develop promotions and products to appeal to certain customer segments and eventually enhance their sales. With data being important for every industry, the usage of data

## What are the methods of Privacy-preserving data mining?
Downgrading the effectiveness of data mining results − In several cases, even though the data cannot be available, the output of data mining (e.g, association rules and classification models) can result in violations of privacy. The solution can be to downgrade the efficiency of data mining by changing data or mining results, including hiding

##  CHAPTER An Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Data Mining with Fuzzy C 
Using fuzzy c-means as the data-mining tool, this study evaluates the effectiveness of sampling methods in producing the knowledge of interest. The effectiveness is shown in terms of the representative-ness of sampling data and both the accuracy and errors of sampled data sets when subjected to the fuzzy clustering algorithm.
