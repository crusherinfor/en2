## How Gold Electroplating Is Done - Sharretts Plating Company
In all gold plating, the part is polished and cleaned as thoroughly as possible before the electroplating process starts. Gold plating will look uneven and smudged if the surface is dirty, oily, scratched or otherwise damaged. Modern electroplating begins with the creation of a metal salt using the plating metal, typically gold or silver.

## How Is Gold Formed? Origins and Process - ThoughtCo
Gold sank to the Earth's core during the planet's formation. It's only accessible today because of asteroid bombardment. Theoretically, it's possible to form gold by the nuclear processes of fusion, fission, and radioactive decay. It's easiest for scientists to transmute gold by bombarding the heavier element mercury and producing gold via decay.
