## Intravenous (IV) Iron Infusion - United Lincolnshire Hospitals
An IV iron infusion is a way to increase the body's iron levels quickly. It's a more immediate treatment than tablets or dietary changes. The body needs iron to make haemoglobin (Hb), a protein that is found in red blood cells. Haemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Iron helps our muscles store and use oxygen.
