## Pelletizing - Assignment Point
Pelletizing of iron ore. The principle behind pelletizing processes is the opposite of grinding technology: it consists of gathering together or clustering fine solid particles in order to form elements of larger dimensions. Iron ore pellets are spheres of typically 6-16 mm (0.24-0.63 in) to be used as raw material for blast furnaces.

## Iron Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The chemical composition of direct-ship and beneficiated iron ores can be divided into high-grade hematite ores, with 64-67% Fe and low SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3, largely from Brazil and West Africa (e.g., Simandou); a number of Australian and other iron ores with ~ 60-62% Fe; high-LOI martite-goethite Australian ores; and high-LOI Australian CID

## The Iron Pelletizing Process: Part One :: Total Materia Article
The pelletizing process is a process which contains numerous sub-processes, or process segments. On the way from the mine to a final product, the iron ore goes through the following main process segments: 1) The iron ore is crushed and the waste rock is removed. About 85 % of the particles should be less than 44 μm (in length, width, or height).
