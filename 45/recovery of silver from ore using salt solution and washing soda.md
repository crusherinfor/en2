## Salt and Silver - University of Nevada, Reno
Salt and Silver. Common salt, sodium chloride, was perhaps the first nonmetallic mineral to be mined in Nevada. Great quantities of salt were used in the processing of ores from the various silver mines around the state, and most of this salt was recovered from playa lakebeds, or "marshes" in western Nevada. Probably the first salt to be mined

It was made by reacting lithium hydroxide with fatty acids. At this time, modern lithium soap (thickener) consists of 12HSA (12-hydroxystearic acid, or triglycerides) with lithium hydroxide monohydrate in a base fluid. Grease is one of the oldest lubricants used by humans dating back to 1400BC.[3]. It reduces friction as well as resists water.

While working in Ecuador I recovered more than a kilo of silver that had been dissolved by using too much salt water in a process tank by adding silver nitrate solution to eliminate the excess Cl- ions. I do not recommend it, but lead nitrate or mercury nitrate would also work to remove the excess Cl- ions to recover the silver from solution.

Up to 95% of silver and copper has been recovered from electrolysis of spent solar cells in research studies, and a standard silicon solar cell module of 60 cells contains approximately 6 g of silver. At a 95% recovery, 5.7 g (0.183 ozt) of silver at $15.79 USD/ ozt equates to $2.89 USD/module.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

## Cleaning silver with water, baking soda, salt and foil
you're reducing the silver in silver sulfide. the blackening comes from silver reacting with H2S in food/air. silver doesn't need to touch the aluminium. bc adding baking soda, or table salt, will enable the flow of electrons from aluminium to silver. I googled and you are correct that it is silver sulfide, not silver oxide.

For the synthesis of ZnO doped with transition metal (silver) a solid mixture of 1 -5% AgNO 3 in ZnSO 4.7H 2O was dissolved separately in 50 ml distilled water and then mixed with buffer solution of sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide, followed by the same procedure as for undoped ZnO. Sodium hydroxide precipitates the silver oxide.

## Extractive metallurgy
Extractive metallurgy is a branch of metallurgical engineering wherein process and methods of extraction of metals from their natural mineral deposits are studied. The field is a materials science, covering all aspects of the types of ore, washing, concentration, separation, chemical processes and extraction of pure metal and their alloying to suit various applications, sometimes for direct

## Common Silver Extraction Methods - Mining-pedia
The common gold-silver ore extraction process has the following types: 1. Flotation + Flotation concentrate cyanidation. The sulfide ore containing gold, silver and quartz veins is subjected to flotation process to obtain a small amount of concentrate, which is then sent to cyanidation process.
