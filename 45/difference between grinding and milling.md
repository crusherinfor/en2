## Difference Between Milling and Drilling - WMW Machinery Company
The first obvious distinguishing characteristic between the two is the direction by which the equipment cuts through a material. When using a drilling machine, you need to move the cutting attachment in a vertical motion to pierce and remove parts of the workpiece. Milling machines, on one hand, utilizes either a horizontal or vertical motion
