## How To Get Gold Out Of Rock - Realonomics
How do you extract gold from its ore? For extracting gold from low-grade ores heap leaching is practiced huge heaps are sprayed with a dilute solution of sodium cyanide and this percolates down through the piled ore dissolving the gold. Can you find real gold in rocks? Real gold is a very rare and valuable metal.

Copper ore usually contains about 0.5 to 2% copper that occurs in the form of disseminated and stringers. The run of mine ore is reduced from 150 mm to 25 mm size in Jaw and Cone crushers. The crushed ore is grinded in ball mills to âˆ’74 Î¼m size. The ore is processed by froth flotation comprising rougher and scavenger cells.
