## Limestone, scaling, fouling in water - Vesi Process
Hard water creates white deposits (limestone) inside the pipes and also outside the pipes at the joints. This is why limestone is, after the taste, the second ground of not drinking tap water. These disadvantages increase especially with heated water. Indeed the rate of limestone deposits increases with the temperature.

## How limestone caves are formed - Maropeng
A limestone cave or cavern is a natural cavity that is formed underneath the Earth's surface that can range from a few metres to many kilometres in length and depth. Most of the world's caves, including those at the Cradle of Humankind, are formed in porous limestone. Over millions of years, acidic groundwater or underground rivers dissolve

Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

Most limestones actually start as calcium carbonate mud or shells precipitated by organisms in reefs or shallow shelf regions - the biosphere. Lime mud gets buried by overlying sediments over long periods of time and turns into limestone.

## How does limestone change throughout the rock cycle?
Limestone usually starts in the biosphere, gets recycled into the lithosphere or geosphere, moves to the atmosphere then back to the biosphere. Most limestones actually start as calcium carbonate mud or shells precipitated by organisms in reefs or shallow shelf regions - the biosphere. Lime mud gets buried by overlying sediments over long periods of time and turns into limestone. Limestone in

## Limestone for pH Adjustment in Industrial Wastewater Neutralzation 
Limestone is an alkaline agent with the ability to neutralize, or partially neutralize strong acids. The neutralization process occurs when strong acids, in intimate contact with limestone chips, react with Calcium Carbonate (CaCO 3, the primary constituent of limestone) to form water, carbon dioxide, and calcium salts.
