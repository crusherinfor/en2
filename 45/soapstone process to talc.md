p 193. [ Massive Talc /p 193] Soapstone is properly applied to an impure form of steatite which contains varying amounts of chlorite, tremolite, pyroxene, magnetite, pyrite, quartz, and carbonates of calcium and magnesium. Its impurity is due to the fact that it is usually derived from the alteration of a basic, igneous rock, often pyroxenite.
