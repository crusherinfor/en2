Cyanide. In the late 1800s, cyanide started to be used to concentrate and capture gold from ore in a similar process to the mercury extraction, but is more efficient and loses less gold to the tailings. Once the rock is pulverized, it is mixed with water to create a slurry and a cyanide solution is added. This aqueous cyanide solution dissolves the gold and can then be extracted using a number
