## Radon Exposure from Granite: Debunking Health Concerns
Radon Exposure from Granite: Debunking Health Concerns. Like all stone, granite contains trace amounts of radium, which decays over time into a naturally-occurring gas called radon, emitting low levels of radiation. Stone quarry workers are surrounded by massive amounts of granite on a daily basis. Should they be concerned about their health?

Radiation exposure to healthy lung tissue may cause inflammation and coughing. Damage to healthy tissues in the gastrointestinal tract may cause pain, nausea or diarrhea, Dr. Bauer says. And the risk remains that radiation therapy to treat cancers in young people may increase their chance of developing second cancers later in life.

## Assessment of occupational exposure in a granite quarry and processing 
In order to assess the risk, a granite industry with a quarry and processing factory was selected to assess the occupational exposure. Three main potential pathways were observed: external irradiation, inhalation of granite dust, and radon exposure. The external dose rate was similar to that in a nearby farming area.

Soft body tissues allow X-rays to pass through freely and appear dark on exposed X-ray films. Dense portions of the body, such as bones and teeth, block X-rays and show up as white on X-ray films. Pregnant women are at risk of X-ray dangers and are almost never given X-rays because of the vulnerability of fetal tissues to radiation, says NCBI.
