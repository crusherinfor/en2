## Iron Ore - Official Terraria Wiki
Iron Ore is an early-game ore that generates upon world creation on the surface, as well as in the Underground and Cavern layers. Its primary use is in crafting Iron Bars, which can then be used to craft the Iron tier of tools, weapons, and armor, as well as Buckets, Chains, and several other items. The equivalent of Iron Ore is Lead Ore, which will sometimes replace Iron in a world.

## Archaeometallurgical slag
The ores used in ancient smelting processes were rarely pure metal compounds. Impurities were removed from the ore through the process of slagging, which involves adding heat and chemicals. Slag is the material in which the impurities from ores (known as gangue), as well as furnace lining and charcoal ash, collect. The study of slag can reveal information about the smelting process used at the

## Copperbookdate
Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon content (less than 0.08%) in contrast to that of cast iron (2.1% to 4%). It is a semi-fused mass of iron with fibrous slag inclusions (up to 2% by weight), which gives it a "grain" resembling wood that is visible when it is etched, rusted, or bent to the point of failure..
