Coal is a great source of energy gifted by the nature. Main hazard in the use of coal is the production of sulphur oxides, sulphur dioxides, and nitrogen oxides which affect the climate severely. To protect environment from these hazardous oxides of sulphur, clean coal technology is being introduced and applied all over the world.

## Coke (fuel)
Coke is a grey, hard, and porous coal-based fuel with a high carbon content and few impurities, made by heating coal or oil in the absence of air—a destructive distillation process. It is an important industrial product, used mainly in iron ore smelting, but also as a fuel in stoves and forges when air pollution is a concern..

## washability test of coal
Jul 27, 2020· In washability tests, coal samples are separated into float and sink fractions in liquids of increasing density. If a coal sample will be sent to a preparation plant that uses a fixed density for separating coal from rock and minerals, then a single float-sink test may be done on a sample at the fluid density used in the plant.
