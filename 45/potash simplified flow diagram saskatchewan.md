Nov 8, 2021The Process of Potash Solution Mining. Here in Saskatchewan, potash is extracted from deep underground deposits (generally 1,000 m or 1 km deep), using either conventional mining or solution mining. Conventional mining (using traditional mining machines) requires the mechanical extraction and conveying of the ore and surrounding minerals.

Potassium is one of the three basic plant nutrients along with nitrogen and phosphorus. There is no substitute for potassium compounds in agriculture; they are essential to maintain and expand food production. Potash is extracted from buried ancient evaporites by underground or solution mining. This accounts for most of the potassium produced.
