Iron also plays an important role in our health. We are red-blooded thanks to the atoms of iron in every red blood cell. It grabs oxygen, carries it where needed, and releases it. Without it, we would be anemic and die. Some iron minerals like magnetite, or lodestone, are attracted to a magnet. Others are not.

Iron is a mineral found in every cell of the body. Iron is considered an essential mineral because it is needed to make hemoglobin, a part of blood cells.  Babies moving to solid foods should eat iron-rich foods. Infants are born with enough iron to last about six months. An infant's extra iron needs are met by breast milk.
