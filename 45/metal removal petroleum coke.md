## Metal Removal Petroleum Coke Modular Belt Washbo
Oct 01 2019 Petroleum coke is a by-product of the bitumen upgrading process. Owing to its low price and abundance petroleum coke has been reported to be an attractive adsorbent for NAs removal from OSPW. The adsorption equilibrium of acid-extractable organics by petroleum coke follow both Langmuir and Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm models.

## Petrol Coke - Cargo Handbook - the world's largest cargo transport 
Description. Petroleum coke (often abbreviated Pet coke or petcoke) is a carbonaceous solid derived from oil refinery coker units or other cracking processes.Other coke has traditionally been derived from coal. This coke can either be fuel grade (high in sulphur and metals) or anode grade (low in sulphur and metals). The raw coke directly out of the coker is often referred to as green coke.

The feasibility of the reuse of petroleum coke, withof high sulphur content, produced as waste in a Mexican petroleum refinery, its properties for use in water treatment was were assessed. Several classical activation methods were used and the physicochemical characteristics of the treated material were measured using normal ASTM standards.

## Green Petroleum Coke and Its Use in Aluminum Industry
The production of different sorts of coke is influenced by the unit feedstock and operating conditions [11, 23]. The main types of green delayed petroleum coke can be classified as shot coke, sponge/fuel coke, sponge/honeycomb coke (also called anode-grade coke), and needle coke [11, 29]. They are explained in the following paragraphs.

## Impurity Removal from Petroleum Coke | SpringerLink
Abstract. The question of treating high-impurity coke to enable use in anodes was examined. A mineralogical analysis of different cokes demonstrated that more than 99 % of the particles contained the expected concentrations of sulfur, nickel, and vanadium while a small number of particles contained inclusions of other impurities.

## Metal passivation for anode grade petroleum coke
The present invention relates to the use of petroleum coke for the manufacture of carbonaceous anodes for the aluminum smelting industry. The inclusion of Group 4 and/or Group 13 metal compounds as additives to the petroleum coker feedstock diminish the oxidizing tendencies of the metal impurities inherent in the petroleum coke.

## Metal passivation for anode grade petroleum coke
The use of magnesium-based materials to passivate metal impurities in petroleum coke has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,427,540. However, other useful materials that can passivate the metal impurities in petroleum coke are needed.  is calcined in a rotary kiln at temperatures between 1200-C and 1400-C resulting in the removal of excess
