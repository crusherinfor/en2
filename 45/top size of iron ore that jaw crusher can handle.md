## A Detailed Overview of Cone Crushers and What You Need to Know
For this reason, companies typically deploy cone crushers as part of a more extensive system of crushing equipment. A first-stage crusher, such as an impact or jaw crusher is used to break raw material down to a size that the cone crusher can accommodate. Cone crushers are typically looked at as a secondary or tertiary stage of crushing.

To achieve this top size, the crusher setting is 200mm or below, depending on the rock characteristics.  Scalping is usually recommended before a jaw crusher, whereas gyratory crushers can handle the excavated ore as is. This is because primary gyratories are not as sensitive to fines: they are large, steep and have a relatively short stroke

All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.
