## Different Gold Ore Processing Methods for 5 Kinds of Gold Ore
According to the degree of ore oxidation, gold ore can be divided into primary (sulfide ore) ore, partially oxidized (mixed) ore and oxidized ore. Here are the different kind of gold ore processing methods used for five types of gold ore . Poor sulfide gold ore processing. Polysulfide gold ore processing. Gold-bearing polymetallic ore processing.

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.
