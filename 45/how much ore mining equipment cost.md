## cost of new iron ore mining equipment
As strip ratios often determine the economic feasibility of an iron ore deposit, low strip ratios will ensure most operations have low mining costs per tonne. BHP's Yandi is the lowest cost operation, yielding an estimated FOB cost of US$17.65 per tonne last year, followed by Rio's Messa operations. Both mines are in the WA's Pilbara region.

## How Asteroid Mining Will Work | HowStuffWorks
Scraping, or strip mining, will pull out valuable ore that will float off the asteroid. Because much of the ore will fly off, a large canopy might be used to collect it. Asteroids have nearly no gravity, so the mining equipment, and the astronaut-miners who operate it, will have to use grapples to anchor themselves to the ground.

## mining - Underground mining | Britannica
When any ore body lies a considerable distance below the surface, the amount of waste that has to be removed in order to uncover the ore through surface mining becomes prohibitive, and underground techniques must be considered. Counting against underground mining are the costs, which, for each ton of material mined, are much higher underground than on the surface.
