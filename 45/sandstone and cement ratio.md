## How to lay Indian Sandstone? | Perfect Pave Ltd | Perfect Pave Ltd
There is much discussion on this subject but the short answer has to be no. Laying sandstone paving should only be done with a full wet bed of Mortar at a ratio of 5.1 sand and cement and the slabs should be primed individually before laying using a slurry primer to aid with adhesion and to prevent salt blooms.

## What Are the Mix Ratios for Cement and Sand?
More water, cement or sand can be added if the mixture is too wet or dry. Below is an example of a sand to cement mix ratio recommendation from a cement manufacturer. Concrete - 1 part cement, 2 parts concreting sand and 3 parts 20 millimeter aggregate. Mortar - 1 part cement, 4 to 5 parts building sand.

## Concrete Mix Ratio: What Is It? What Is 1-2-3? .And More.
A concrete mix ratio is usually expressed by a set of numbers separated by colons, as is the case with a 1:2:3 ratio. This tells the mixer that they need to add 1 part cement powder, 2 parts sand, and 3 parts aggregate in order to create the desired concrete consistency. Water is not included in these ratios, though, because it can vary more

## Correct mortar mix for stone wall | Screwfix Community Forum
The lime mortar should always be softer than the stone and generally I use a 4:1 mix. It is more expensive than using Portland cement, but if you have taken the time to use lime with the house, it would be a shame not to have a matching wall. Lime is also a natural fungicide, so the wall will remain looking better for longer.

Samples were compacted and cured under dry and wet conditions before measuring their unconfined compressive strength (UCS), indirect tensile strength (ITS), and California bearing ratio (CBR).
