## Mechanical Properties of Aggregate - Construction How
1)Compressive Strength. The maximum strength shown by aggregates when subjected to compression gives their compressive strength. It is to be remembered that crushed stones are obtained from by squashing large-sized boulders. Therefore, aggregates are intrinsic materials and their compressive strength depends largely on the rock type that is crushed (for coarse aggregates).

Crushing strength of stone: It is defined as load per unit area at which stone starts cracking. It depends on: 1. The texture of stone ensures whether the stone is rough or smooth hence friction between the surface of the stone and the CTM machine depends on the texture and hence crushing strength of stone also depends on texture. 2.

## What is uniaxial compressive strength of rock? - No Rush Charge
What is crushing strength of stone? Explanation: Crushing strength or compressive strength of a stone is the load per unit area at which the stone starts cracking. It should be greater than 100 N/mm 2 to ensure sufficient strength for use in construction.
