## The aluminum market value is projected to reach some 250 billion U.S 
Its lighter weight means that less force is required to move the vehicle, leading to greater fuel efficiency. We elaborate the uses of aluminum and atomic properties with characteristics. Aluminium is a silver-looking chemical element with atomic number 13. Its symbol is Al and it belongs to the group of metals of the p-block and its usual
