## Copper Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In most cases, the thin-layer process was used where crushed ores (80% −0.5 in) were stacked in heaps of 3-8 m height after agglomeration and sprayed at flow rates of 6-40 L·hour −1 ·m −2 with 15-90 days duration for copper oxides and 10-18 months for sulfides. Of note, 80%-85% copper extraction was commonly achieved.
