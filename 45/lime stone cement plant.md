## Abandoned Lime cement plant - Traveling the PNW
The Acme Cement Plaster Company built a plant at Lime in 1916 to produce plaster. The Sun Portland Cement Company bought the plant in 1921 and built another facility for producing Portland cement. At its peak it produced 1.2 million barrels a year, before eventually closing in 1980.

May 20, 2021Plants that grow well in alkaline soil and prefer a pH level closer to 7 need lime. Peas, spinach, onions, cabbages are some of the vegetable plants that require lime. In terms of flowers, the use of lime would benefit ornamental flowers such as butterfly bushes and delphinium. Many other plants require lime to grow and reach their full potential.

## Portland-Limestone Cement
Producers know that replacing some of the clinker in portland cement with ground limestone offers benefits, the most important being that it reduces the embodied CO2 of the cement. Modifying a concrete mix design to replace higher carbon materials with lower carbon ingredients is an effective strategy to reduce its environmental footprint.

OPC 43 and OPC 53-grade cement mixed with sand is also known as cement-sand plaster. PPC cement is preferred over OPC-grade cement for plastering. A single coat of plaster in the interior walls is enough to finish. If the thickness of the plaster is more than 15 mm or the exterior needs finishing, two coats of plaster are required.

The added limestone in the U.S. is modern portland cement and consists of ground clinker, a source of readily soluble sulfates and functional additives. The change is that the specification adds up to 5% limestone. The biggest difference in production is that the limestone is added to the clinker blend before grinding.
