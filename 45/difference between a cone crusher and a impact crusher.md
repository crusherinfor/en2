## P&Q University Lesson 7- Crushing & Secondary Breaking
Between stages, screens with two or three decks separate the material that already is the proper size. Most secondary crushers are cone crushers or horizontal-shaft impact crushers. Tertiary and quaternary crushers are usually cone crushers, although some applications can call for vertical-shaft impact crushers in these stages. GYRATORY CRUSHER

## Impact vs cone crushers: Which is more effective? - Quarry
The post-primary crushing sector is largely divided into impact crushers for the processing of softer stone and cone crushers for the processing of harder, more abrasive stone. The advantages of both machines are well known. The impact crusher, for example, has a higher co-efficient of reduction, produces crushed material with an optimal cubic

## The Differences Between Cone Crusher and Impact Crusher
The impact crusher not only crushes the material, but also has a certain function of shaping the particles. The distribution is more reasonable and the grain shape is beautiful. In contrast, although the crushing effect of the cone crusher is good, it is slightly inferior to the impact crusher in the shaping of the discharged particles. 3.
