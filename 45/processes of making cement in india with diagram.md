While the process of making cement uses a number of tools, the production of concrete requires only a concrete mixer. In the first stage of making cement, limestone and clay are crushed together to form a powder. This powder is then combined in a mixer betore passing into a rotating heater which has constant heat applied at one end of the tube.
