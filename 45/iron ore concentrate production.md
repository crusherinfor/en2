## Market - Nordic Iron Ore
There are mainly four types of iron ore products: concentrate, sinter feed, pellets and lump ore.

## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes
Concentrate/ground iron ore of typical size 80 % less than 45 microns (0.045 mm) with a moisture content of around 9 % is required for the pellet production. Suitable binder (normally bentonite) is added to the concentrate which is thoroughly mixed in high intensity mixer.
