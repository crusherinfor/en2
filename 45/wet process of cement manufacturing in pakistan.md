## Cement Manufacturing Process: How the Cement is Made?
In the earlier part of the century i.e., from 1913 to 1960, the wet process was used for the manufacture of cement. From 1913 onwards, the cement industry underwent a number of changes mainly to suit the requirements of the manufacturers and the govt. policies till early 1982.

Wet Process The wet process method is manufacturing raw materials slurry with 32%-40% water content. Wet process method's advantage is that its good fluidity of raw materials slurry makes more even mixed materials and produces high-quality clinker. But it requires more heat consumption, so it is environment-friendly.

The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of

Cement Industry Overview. Since 1974 the number of wet process kilns has dropped from 234 to 25 -- a decline of 89 percent -- while the number of dry process kilns has only been reduced from 198 to 124. Well over three quarters of existing U.S. clinker production capacity has been built since 1975 -- all utilizing the dry manufacturing process.

Wet process kilns. The original rotary cement kilns were called 'wet process' kilns. In their basic form they were relatively simple compared with modern developments. The raw meal was supplied at ambient temperature in the form of a slurry. A wet process kiln may be up to 200m long and 6m in diameter.
