It is important to match the CSS of the crusher to the top size of the product to be produced. If the circuit is being closed at 25mm (1") to produce a 25mm minus product, the crusher should be set at, near or slightly below 25mm. {{image3-a:l-w:640}} Impact crushers.

However, using a recycled aggregate of more than 65% can impact the mix's durability significantly, reducing its physical properties tenfold. The optimum amount blended in with the concrete should be 35%. Some experiments have shown that the recycled aggregate is durable, no doubt, but not as sturdy as natural coarse aggregate.

Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete. After harvesting, aggregate is processed: crushed, screened, and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.

## Mobile Concrete Crushers: 90-385 TPH | RUBBLE MASTER
Compact Concrete Crushers for non-spec material (jaw or impact) start at $150,000. Small bucket crusher attachments go for a little less but are very slow and lack the ability to separate rebar efficiently. Large closed-circuit tracked impact crushers can go upwards to $750,000 - $1,000,000. Of course, there are numerous options in between.
