## Select Sand & Gravel - Crushed Rock
This article is the result of the questions Select Sand & Gravel receives regarding the uses of Crushed Limestone Rock versus Crushed Concrete Rock. We determined it would be useful to outline the differences in these types of Rock. These types of rock are abundant in the Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio, and Houston Texas areas.

## Limestone and Lime - IspatGuru
Limestone when heated starts decomposing into lime (CaO) and carbon di-oxide (CO2) at 810 deg C. The process is called calcination of limestone. It is a thermal treatment process which is carried out for the thermal decomposition of the raw limestone for the removal of LOI (loss on ignition) or carbon di-oxide (CO2) part of its composition.

The screening process starts by removing larger stones, then medium stones, and eventually goes all the way down to the stone dust.  One of the most versatile rocks for construction, limestone is able to be crushed easily making it a primary rock used in ready-mix concrete, road construction, and railroads. It is widely available in quarries
