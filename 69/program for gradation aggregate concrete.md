In Concrete mix design, crucial part is taking proportion of aggregates. How one can know the mix is under sanded or over sanded or may have voids in it etc. To analyze this we do check the gradation of aggregates according to relevant standard for conformity.

## Gradation of Aggregates and its Effects on Properties of Concrete
It is desirable to optimize the aggregate gradation in concrete as cement is the most expensive components of concrete. Therefore one obvious goal is to minimize the void content within the aggregates and thus reduce the volume of cement paste required to achieve a workable, economical and an environmentally sound concrete for a given application.
