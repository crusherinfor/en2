1.Size of Coarse Aggregates: The size of the coarse aggregate depends on the use of the concrete is to be poured. For large-scale concreting operations without complex reinforcement, large aggregates of size 80 mm, 40 mm, 20 mm are used. For the simple construction of residential or other buildings, 20 mm is the maximum size will be used.
