## Climate risk and decarbonization: What every mining CEO needs to know 
How mining can decarbonize. The mining industry generates between 1.9 and 5.1 gigatons of CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 e) of GHG emissions annually. The majority of emissions in this sector originate from fugitive coal-bed methane that is released during coal mining (1.5 to 4.6 gigatons), mainly at underground operations. 7

If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground it can be extracted through surface mining. In surface mining workers simply remove any overlying sediment vegetation and rock called overburden.

Until the 1950s coal was primary mined underground east of the Mississippi River. By the 1970s, the development of cheaper surface mining proved a viable alternative for the coal industry. Currently the Powder River Basin, the Appalachian Basin, and the Illinois Basin are among the largest coal producers in the US.

Like oil, coal is formed over millions of years from plant and animal matter, but unlike oil, coal is a solid, and therefore miners must go into the earth to recover it.
