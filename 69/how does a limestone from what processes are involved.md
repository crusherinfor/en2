## What Does Acid Rain Do to Limestone? | eHow
As acid rain falls to the earth's surface, limestone rocks and limestone components in soil will react with the rain, neutralize the acid and dissolve. As the limestone dissolves, the rocks will wear away, becoming pitted with rounded edges. The dissolution process will change the appearance of the landscape as the rocks slowly wear away over time.

## What Happens When Limestone Is Mixed With Water? - Yes Dirt
Limestone is mostly made of calcium carbonate, with very low solubility in boiling water. If the limestone were crushed into a fine powder, it would dissolve because more surface area would be exposed to the hot water. If you put a piece of limestone (calcium carbonate) in hot water, it will dissolve similarly and dissolve in boiling water.

## How does limestone change throughout the rock cycle?
Lime mud gets buried by overlying sediments over long periods of time and turns into limestone. Limestone in the oceans gets dragged to subduction zones where it gets recycled into the mantle (geosphere), Over time, the limestone is broken down into its chemical parts and may come back to the surface as volcanic CO2 (in the atmosphere).

## how how does limestone process
Limestone, or calcium carbonate, is themon rock found throughout the world. Oldest and perhaps slightly overlooked, limestone is very much part of our everyday life.  Mostly it's due to the algal and bacterial metabolism as the process involves high consumption of carbon dioxide, resulting in saturation of calcium carbonate.
