## Central processing unit
A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program.The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O

## Manufactured Sand for Construction - Structural Guide
Manufactured sand can be considered as a by-product of the process of producing coarse aggregates. When the rock is crushed into small particles, fine aggregates are produced. Due to the increasing demand in the construction sector, there is a difficulty in supplying the rever sand continuously to meet the demand.
