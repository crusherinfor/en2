## gypsum processing and use
The largest gypsum quarry in the world, Gold Bond's Milford, Nova Scotia operation, produces four and a half to five million tons of ore per year. The quarry process begins by first removing the earth over the deposit. Then gypsum ore is drilled and blasted loose to be carried to the processing plant, where it is crushed and screened.
