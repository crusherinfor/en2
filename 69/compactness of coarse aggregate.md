Oct 2, 2021What is Coarse Aggregate? The Aggregates which will get retained on the 4.75 mm (No. 4) sieve and will pass through a 3-inch sieve are known as Coarse aggregate. The aggregates used in the production of concrete are inert granular materials such as gravel, crushed stone, sand, slag, and recycled concrete.

smaller sized coarse aggregate produces higher strengths for a given water-to-cement ratio. In fact, it is generally agreed that, although larger coarse aggregates can be used to make high-strength concrete, it is easier to do so with coarse aggregates below 12.5 mm (Y, in.) (ACI 363-95).
