## Quartz Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart | Cases - JXSC
Natural quartz crystals have too many chemical impurities and physical flaws. As a result, a commercial process of manufacturing pure, flawless, electronics-grade quartz was developed. "Cultured quartz," that is, quartz crystals grown very carefully in highly controlled laboratory conditions, is the quartz that is used in industry.

## quartz uses in industry - Axsie
The petroleum industry uses quartz sand for its high resistance properties, in a process called- hydraulic fracturing. In this process, high purified quartz with round grains is compressed under very high pressure into the oil and gas wells. The high pressure leads to fractures in the reservoir rocks, and quartz sand gets inside the fractures.
