## gold milling process in africa
Gold is processed by cyanide milling, a chemical procedure that separates 95 to 98 percent of the gold from raw mined ore. It is then refined to the gold standard purity, according to Mineweb. Heap leaching is a less expensive method of gold extraction, but it is a longer process and it recovers less gold than the cyanide milling process.

Where Did Gold Come From In West Africa? Gold was mined to the south of the newly emergent polity at the headwaters of Niger and Senegal rivers in what has become known as the Bure and Bambuk goldfields respectively. Traders and merchants from Ghana traded for gold from these mining areas by means of what has become known as 'silent trade' or dumb barter.
