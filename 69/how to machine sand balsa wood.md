The wood harder is mainly used to strengthen your wood actually. You should put the balsa wood into the container to submerge it. Ensure that the container is deep enough to submerge the thickest piece of balsa wood that you have cut.

I usually steam the wood for about 30 minutes or so. I have a pre-made (just a board with nails) that is the shape of the arch I want. Actually, I usually bend the wood more than I really want it, because the wood will "unbend" somewhat after it drys. I use clothespins to hold the wood against the nails.

## Sanding for beginners | Dremel
Firstly, sanding can turn an average project into a great one. Wood straight from the mill can be rough, or contain dents and other marks. Wood sanding helps to smooth the wood's surface. It can also emphasise the beauty of the wood's natural grain. In addition to wood sanding, sanding tools can remove rust from metal and polish fibreglass.
