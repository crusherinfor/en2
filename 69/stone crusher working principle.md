## The working principle of limestone crusher - News of Joyal Crusher
Jan 28, 2021The hammer crusher mainly relies on impact energy to complete the crushing of materials. When the hammer crusher is working, the motor drives the rotor to rotate at a high speed, and the material enters the crusher cavity evenly. The high-speed rotating hammer impacts, shears and tears the material and causes the material to be broken.
