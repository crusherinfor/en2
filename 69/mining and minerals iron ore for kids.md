## Economic Iron Bearing Minerals
Australia has always traditionally had large reserves of hematite, and since the 1960's it has been the main iron-bearing mineral mined in ore. Around 96% of all iron ore exported from Australia is hematite of high grade. The Hamersley province in Western Australia is the source of the majority of the hematite mined in Australia, around 80%.

The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron. Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel. Steel is used to make automobiles, locomotives, ships, beams used in buildings, furniture, paper clips, tools, reinforcing rods for concrete, bicycles, and thousands of other items. It is the most-used metal by both tonnage and purpose.

## Metal and Iron Ore Mining | MCR Safety
The Iron Age began around 1200 BC, ending the Bronze Age that preceded it and paving the way to man's mastery of metal. Individuals during this period began extracting iron ore to forge tools and weapons. The reason revolves around Iron being one of the most abundant metals found on earth. Iron makes up 98% of earth's core and 5% of earth

## Ores And Minerals - Definition, Types & Differences with Videos - BYJUS
Ore is a deposit of one or more precious minerals in the Earth's crust. The most important ore deposits, such as copper, silver, and iron, contain metals that are essential to industry and trade. Copper ore is mined for a wide range of industrial applications. Copper, an exceptional electricity conductor, is used as an electrical wire.

## Iron Ore | Geoscience Australia
In 2018, Australia's EDR of iron ore increased by 3% from 2017 to 49 604 Mt (Table 3). Similarly, there was a 4% EDR increase of contained iron to 24 122 Mt (Table 4). EDR attributable to magnetite deposits have decreased by 1%, likely due to re-assessment of projects and inactivity in the magnetite industry.
