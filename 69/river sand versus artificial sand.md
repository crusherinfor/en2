## Difference between M Sand and River sand (22 Differences)
Concrete with M sand has much worse permeability than river sand. When river sand is used in concrete, the permeability of concrete is lower than river sand. It has 2 to 4% more water absorption. The water absorption of river sand is less than 1.5 to 3%. Concrete with M sand has less deceleration than river sand.

## Which is better m sand or river sand?idegrillandbar
M sand is a form of artificial sand, manufactured by crushing large hard stones, mainly rocks or granite, into fine particles, which is then washed and finely graded. It is widely used as a substitute for river sand for construction purposes, mostly in the production of concrete and mortar mix.

Since you must keep the roof and the stone, all that's left to lighten the place is the porch colour. I'd choose a sand, inspired by the stone, and accent in black or a dark grey, and use a touch os white where it's practical. A deep plum or mulberry could be a different 'dark' to use, and it would look stunning against the sandy tones.
