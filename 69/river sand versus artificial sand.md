## Difference between M Sand and River sand (22 Differences)
Concrete with M sand has much worse permeability than river sand. When river sand is used in concrete, the permeability of concrete is lower than river sand. It has 2 to 4% more water absorption. The water absorption of river sand is less than 1.5 to 3%. Concrete with M sand has less deceleration than river sand.

Since you must keep the roof and the stone, all that's left to lighten the place is the porch colour. I'd choose a sand, inspired by the stone, and accent in black or a dark grey, and use a touch os white where it's practical. A deep plum or mulberry could be a different 'dark' to use, and it would look stunning against the sandy tones.
