Gold can be freed from these ores or concentrates by treating them with various oxidizing processes. The most common method is to roast gold-bearing minerals at temperatures of 450° to 750° C (840° to 1,380° F) to destroy the interfering sulfides. Oxidation can also be accomplished by the use of high-pressure reactors called autoclaves, in
