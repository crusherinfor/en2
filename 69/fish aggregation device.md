## Fish Aggregating Devices - Department of Primary Industries
Fish Aggregating Devices. Fisheries Aggregating Devices, or FADs, are strategically placed along the NSW coast during the warmer months. FADs have a long history of use in NSW, and were first a resource for fishers with the introduction of the Recreational Fishing Fee in 2001. Monitoring of the FADs by DPI has shown mahi mahi (also known as

They can be anchored to the ocean floor (anchored FADs) or set to drift in the open ocean (drifting FADs). FADs are widely used as a fishing method due to its high efficiency, although they have been associated with several negative ecosystem impacts, such as bycatch and

## Fish aggregating device
A fish aggregating (or aggregation) device (FAD) is a man-made object used to attract ocean-going pelagic fish such as marlin, tuna and mahi-mahi (dolphin fish). They usually consist of buoys or floats tethered to the ocean floor with concrete blocks. FADs attract fish for numerous reasons that vary by species. Fish tend to move around FADs in varying orbits, rather than remaining stationary
