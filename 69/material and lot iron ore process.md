Bead wire before rubber vulcanization An estimated 15% of the material in a tire is steel, mainly in the form of cord. Rubber is vulcanized to steel cords that are spirally wrapped to form bead wire. The bead is the part of the tire that attaches to the rim. It takes a lot of pressure to mount a tire on the wheel.

## Sintering: A Step Between Mining Iron Ore and Steelmaking
The only source of primary iron is iron ore, but before all that iron ore can be turned into steel, it must go through the sintering process. Sinter is the primary feed material for making iron and steel in a blast furnace. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the sintering process converts fine-sized raw materials, including

## The value of mineralogical analysis for iron ore mining and 
Accurate mineralogical analyses of iron ore. For this case study, seven samples of lateritic iron ore were analyzed. All samples were prepared as pressed pellets and were measured on Aeris Minerals tabletop diffractometer with a scan time of 10 minutes, followed by an automatic quantitative phase analysis. Figure 1 shows an example of full
