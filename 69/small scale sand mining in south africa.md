Gaps in Uganda's laws also limit the country's ability to regulate sand extraction. The new mining and minerals policy passed in 2018 gives only a basic legal framework. It doesn't define small-scale artisanal sand miners who have often decried unclear licensing and regulating processes that target them rather than large-scale operators.
