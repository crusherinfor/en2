## Mining of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

Iron Mining Process - Minnesota Iron. The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism. The remaining rock is waste material and is dumped into tailings basins. The taconite powder with the iron in it is called concentrate. Pellets The concentrate (the wet taconite powder) is rolled with clay inside large rotating cylinders.

## Iron mining in the United States
Iron mining in the United States produced 48 million metric tons of iron ore in 2019. [1] Iron ore was the third-highest-value metal mined in the United States, after gold and copper. [2] Iron ore was mined from nine active mines and three reclamation operations in Michigan, Minnesota, and Utah. Most of the iron ore was mined in northern

## How does mine drainage occur? | U.S. Geological Survey
Mine drainage is formed when pyrite (an iron sulfide) is exposed and reacts with air and water to form sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can precipitate to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage. The acid runoff further dissolves heavy metals such as copper, lead, and mercury into groundwater or surface water.
