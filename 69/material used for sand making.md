## Material Used For Sand Making
Sep 29, 2016 In this article, we will learn about the types of moulding sand. Sands which are used to make a mould is called moulding sand. Almost every manufacturing industries uses moulding sand to make moulds. The casting of materials without the use of moulding sand is impossible. Here we are going to discuss different types of moulding sand.

Especially grade level cement. Especially in a climate with winters like ours in Pennsylvania. A worse way to go about it would be to lay the flagstone upon a bed of gravel and then cement the joints between stones. Horrible idea. The gravel base is flexible and will move ever so slightly during freeze-thaw.
