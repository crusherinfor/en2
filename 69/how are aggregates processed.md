## How Aggregates Are Extracted | Construction Materials - CEMEX USA
Sand and gravel quarries are pumped to allow them to be worked dry or operated as lakes with extraction below water. A conveyor draws raw material into the processing plant, where it is washed to remove unwanted clay and to separate sand. Sand separated during processing is dewatered and stockpiled. Gravel then passes over a series of screens

## how are aggregates processed
Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete. After harvesting, aggregate is processed: crushed, screened, and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.

## Recycled Aggregate - CalRecycle Home Page
Recycled aggregate comes primarily from PCC and AC from road rehabilitation and maintenance, demolition, and leftover batches of AC and PCC. After processing, the rocks retain bits of cement or asphalt. A roadway is built in several layers: pavement, base, and sometimes subbase. The pavement is the surface layer, and is made of PCC or AC.

## Recycled Concrete Aggregate- How to Make It and What Is It Used for?
Concrete aggregates are usually divided into two types: uprocessed concrete aggregate and processed aggregate. The former means that the concete waste experiences only crushing process, thus the RCA concrete may contain impurities. Processed concrete aggregate are usually even and fine-sized aggregate.
