## Common Types of Mining Equipment Used in the Mining Industry
Mar 25, 2021Open-pit mining requires creating a large pit in the ground from which the miners extract the needed material. This is one method miners may use to extract silver from the earth. The other technique is underground silver mining. Occasionally, removing a hilltop with explosives to expose the rocky materials beneath is the first step in creating

## The Open-Pit Mining Method Is Used When Large Coal Or Ore Deposits Are 
The Open-pit Mining Method Is Used When Large Coal Or Ore Deposits Are Found _____.? Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.It is applied to ore or rocks found at the surface because the overburden is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunnelling (as would be the case for sand cinder and gravel).

The thickness (that is, the height) of the benches depends on the type of deposit, the mineral being mined, and the equipment being used; for large mines it is on the order of 12 to 15 metres (about 40 to 50 feet).

Open Pit Mining. Open pit mining, also known as strip mining, is the removal of surficial soils and uneconomic rock to get at the ore below. Ore grades are normally less than 0.5%. This is type of mining is only possible if the uranium ore is near the surface (normally less than 400 ft).

Open-pit mining occurs on surface and is generally the cheapest way to extract ore. This is because rock doesn't have to be moved far up hill against gravity, equipment used can be larger than underground, and it doesn't require more expensive features like ventilation, communications, etc. that underground does.
