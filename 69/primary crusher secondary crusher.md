## What Is Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Crushing?
Secondary crushing, as you can imagine, is the second stage of material processing following its initial reduction. At this stage, material will flow through perhaps a second impactor crusher or even a cone crusher, which is effective at breaking down these types of material. There are also tertiary and even quaternary stages of crushing that

Ideally, the deck on the scalping screen should have a cut point equal to the closed side setting (CSS) of the crusher. The feed size to a secondary crusher is typically in the range of 50 mm to 250 mm (up to 300 mm). If the capacity is higher, the acceptable feed size gets larger. After crushing, the product is in the range of 0-60 mm (75 mm

Where the material is not reduced sufficiently in the primary crusher, it is then crushed by a secondary crusher to achieve the correct size of the material. Wear on parts of the crushers affect the performance and volume of material being crushed, the parts subject to high impact, and abrasive wear include the hammers, rotors, teeth, and mantles.
