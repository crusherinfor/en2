## Notes of Ch 5 Minerals and Rocks| Class 11th Geography - Study Rankers
Rocks. • The earth's crust is composed of rocks. • A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals. • Rock may be hard or soft and in varied colours. For example, granite is hard, soapstone is soft. Gabbro is black and quartzite can be milky white. • Rocks do not have definite composition of mineral constituents.

## Arrangement of layers with rock intrusion and description of rocks from 
Jun 2, 2021The law of superposition simply states that for non- deformed geologic strata, "sedimentary layers are deposited in a time sequence, with the oldest on the bottom and the youngest on the top". Explanation: The bottom layer of rock forms first, which means it is oldest. Each layer above that is younger, and the top layer is youngest of all.

## Ordered monomolecular layers as a template for the regular arrangement 
In contrast, when gold is deposited on a pristine MoS2(0001) surface or on a molecular layer of stearic acid, the gold nanoparticles are randomly distributed on the surface. It is found that the arrangement of gold nanoparticles is largely determined by the deposition rate; faster deposition results in more ordered arrays of gold nanoparticles.
