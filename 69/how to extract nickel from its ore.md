## extraction of nickel from its ore」
nickel deposits in the world. Extraction of Nickel In 1899 Ludwig Mond developed a process for extracting and purifying nickel. The socalled "Mond Process" involves the conversion of nickel oxides to pure nickel metal. The oxide is obtained from nickel ores by a series of treatments including concentration, roasting and smelting of the minerals.

1. Differential flotation or partial differential flotation process. When the content of copper is much more than nickel in the ore, this process can be used to separate the copper as the single concentrate. The advantage of this process is that the copper concentrate with lower nickel content can be obtained directly. 2. Bulk flotation process.
