Answers: 1. Gold (Au) and mercury (Hg) are two separate metals. Therefore, from pure mercury you cannot extract Gold. 2. Amalgamation is better suited to ores in which the gold occurs in the free and cores state. Fine particles of Gold are better treated by Cyanidation. 3. Gold dissolves in aqua regia.

Follow. If mixed together, melted in the copper we'll float. Copper boils at a lower temperature than iron. You could boil it off. If they are particles copper density is so low you should use the gold panning technique to separate them. Concentrated nitric acid will violently dissolve copper, it produces deadly gas though.
