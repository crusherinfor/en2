Gradation is the size distribution of a particular riprap or aggregate. Material that is well graded has a uniform distribution of sizes, within a given minimum and maximum range. Void spaces between the larger rock are filled with the smaller material. Void space is reduced which results in a denser placement of riprap or aggregate that is less.
