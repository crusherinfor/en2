As described above, industrial equipment is required to recycle concrete in the most effective way. When concrete recycling is being considered, make sure to evaluate all options in the market for the crushing procedure.  Concrete aggregate: Recycled concrete can be used as a replacement for new aggregates in a concrete mixture.

## Recycled Concrete Aggregates - Its Uses, Properties, Advantages 
History. Recycled concrete aggregates or Crushed concrete aggregates has been in use since the ancient times, only to be integrated with gravel, sand, and cement to ensure durability. The practice was first recorded in the 1860s. US construction companies were reluctant to use the technique at first since crushing cured concrete proved to be much more cost-intensive in terms of labor.

Therefore, this would reduce the carbon footprint of quarrying virgin aggregates. Different batches of concrete with ratios of 25%, 50% and 75% recycled material will replace the virgin aggregate. The maximum and minimum quantity of recycled aggregate required for an ideal concrete mix design can then be obtained.

Uses of Recycled Aggregate: - Building the base of a road. The underlying layer forms a structural foundation for paving. - Ready mix concrete. This is a mix of water, sand and cement. It can substitute for the brand-new aggregate. This includes uses for walkways, residential streets and concrete paving. - Stabilizing the soil.

Recycled aggregate is usually crushed & screened spoil taken from the demolition sector and consists of a mixture of brick, tile, glass, concrete, wood etc. This product is far cheaper than virgin aggregate but in our opinion produces a substantially inferior product.
