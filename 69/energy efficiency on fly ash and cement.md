## Fly Ash Concrete is Eco-Friendly and Stronger than  - GlobalSpec
The manufacture of traditional concrete also requires high temperatures and a lot of energy, which is far from eco-friendly. Fly ash is a material that is left over after coal dust is burned -- 50 percent of fly ash winds up in landfills and risks leaking into and harming the surrounding environment.

The concept of sustainable development can be traced to the energy (especially fossil oil) crisis and environmental pollution concerns of the 1960s and 1970s. The Rachel Carson book, "Silent Spring", published in 1962, is considered to be one of the first initial efforts to describe sustainable development as related to green building.

On top of all of this, concrete promotes healthy indoor air quality. These homes have fewer air-borne allergens, contaminants and molds than stick-built homes. Additionally, concrete homes can often be built to look like their stick-built counterparts. For those who aren't fans of modern architecture, this may be an attractive selling point.

When mixed with lime and water, fly ash forms a compound similar to Portland cement. This makes fly ash suitable as a prime material in blended cement, mosaic tiles, and hollow blocks, among other building materials. When used in concrete mixes, fly ash improves the strength and segregation of the concrete and makes it easier to pump.
