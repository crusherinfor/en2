## X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) for Mineral Processing
XRD is used for the identification of the mineralogy of samples from various parts of an ore body or mineral process stream. XRD can identify which minerals are present and in what amount. This information is then used to inform geologists responsible for feeding the mill and metallurgists responsible for optimisation of beneficiation.

If you're using Nicehash Miner you can enable the various algos and see what's best to mine. For me, it would move between Daggar (Ether), Octopus (Conflux) and Kapow (Raven). When first run it should have benchmarked various algos and picked the best one. If you're using Quickminer it only mines Ether.

Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

Real gold is softer than mirrored glass, and it won't leave a mark on the mirror. Test your gold nuggets and flakes with a magnet. If the gold is attracted to the magnet, it's not real gold but more likely fool's gold, which contains iron. Poke your gold with a pin. Gold is extremely soft and ductile, so if the gold cracks or splits, chances

This operation is performed for around two hours to ensure complete separation of impurities from the precious metals. Gold and silver form an alloy that is heavier than the slag and sinks to the bottom of the furnace. Once the smelting is complete, the slag is removed and the precious metals are casted in ingots.

The second signal to identify happens when the course of a river or stream suddenly becomes much larger than it was. Indeed, as the bed of the river widens, the water will have more space to flow, and therefore, the water velocity will diminish. As it does, the gold particles will drop to the ground, unable to be carried along by the water[6].
