## Metal Oxides In Soils: The Effects Of Hematite And Magnetite
Magnetite is a form of iron oxide, Fe 3 O 4, which possesses uniquely iron in both the Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ oxidation states. Bearing the form of an inverse spinel, it's magnetic properties are highly valued. Addition of magnetite to soil is advantageous as it can later be removed easily by using magnets. It can occur naturally in soil, or be added as a soil treatment agent.

## Genesis, Uses and Environment Implications of Iron Oxides and Ores
Introduction. The genesis, uses and environmental implications of iron oxides and ores remain a topic of interest to academics, industrial players and environmentalist. Oxides of iron are chemical compounds widely spread naturally, comprising iron and oxygen. Here, two components of oxides are widely spread naturally.

One of the major uses of silica sand is to make glass, and in particular glass bottles. The iron content is one of the major factors that affects the color of the glass. Low iron sands are used to produce clear glass for bottles, while sand with higher iron content is used to make amber glass bottles. Thus, both at the quarry site and in the manufacturing process, monitoring the iron content

Ironsand, also known as iron-sand or iron sand, is a type of sand with heavy concentrations of iron.It is typically dark grey or blackish in colour. It is composed mainly of magnetite, Fe 3 O 4, and also contains small amounts of titanium, silica, manganese, calcium and vanadium.. Ironsand has a tendency to heat up in direct sunlight, causing temperatures high enough to cause minor burns.
