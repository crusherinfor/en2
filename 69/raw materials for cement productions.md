## Cement Manufacturing Process-SBM Industrial Technology Group
Cement Manufacturing Process. . Summary： In brief, cement production has the following 7 steps: crushing and pre-homogenization, raw meal preparation, homogenization of raw meal, preheating decomposition, firing of cement clinker, cement grinding and cement package. Cement is a powdery hydraulic inorganic cementing material.

## Alternative Raw Material Sources For Cement Production
It is generally known that cement id produced from limestone, mar/clay and gypsum by the following three basic process- wet semi- wet aid dry process. The cost of exploiting the limestone: the major raw material constitute about 50% of the production cost which results in the high cost of cement. It therefore becomes imperative to bring down
