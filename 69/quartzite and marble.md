Like quartzite, marble is a metamorphic stone, but it originated as limestone instead of sandstone. It is primarily made of calcium carbonate, and the purest marble is sparkling white. You can see tiny calcite crystals within the stone. Also similar to quartzite, varying colors and veining found in marble result from mineral impurities.

Marble is a metamorphic rock exposed to high temperatures and pressure, and in the end it is composed mainly by two predominant minerals: Dolomite and Calcite. In a funny ironic way, Quartzite is also a metamorphic rock, but consists mostly of quartz, formed by the action of heat and pressure upon sandstone.

Marble is more porous than quartzite. Since marble is a softer stone than quartzite, it is more porous and more susceptible to stains and watermarks. However, this does not mean that quartzite is completely bulletproof to water damage. It is, after all, a natural stone and is naturally porous to some extent.
