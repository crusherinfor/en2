## Potash Mining Solutions | Mine Design Technologies (MDT)
Because potash (potassium chloride or other water-soluble potassium compounds) occurs mostly in sedimentary rock, mining it can be a very tricky business. When soft-rock mining is undertaken, there is always a very real risk of collapse, whether conventional methods like room and pillar (continuous) or solution mining techniques are used.

Since relatively uncontaminated sylvinite ore is the most abundant type worldwide, continuous miners are used in all major potash mining districts.

## Potash Mining: Challenges and Solutions to Dealing with Hydrogen  - SRC
For potash solution mining, when the pond water is re-injected into the deep salt-bearing formation to extract potash, various microorganisms feed off the organic matter. In the absence of air (when the incidentally injected oxygen is used up) underground, the sulfate ion becomes a source of oxygen, leaving hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) as a byproduct.

In 1958, the Potash Company of America became the first potash producer in Canada with the commissioning of an underground potash mine at Patience Lake; however, due to water seepage in its shaft, production stopped late in 1959 and, following extensive grouting and repairs, resumed in 1965. The underground mine was flooded in 1987 and was

The ore at Moab—which actually lies about 1,200 meters (3,900 feet) below the surface and within the Paradox Formation —began to form about 300 million years ago. In Utah, the miners pump water deep underground to reach the potash ore. Potash is soluble, so water dissolves it into a brine.

Potash was the first patent ever issued by the United States government signed by President George Washington on July 31st of 1790. That patent was granted to Samuel Hopkins for the making of potash with a new process and a new machine. Potash remains as important today as it did back in 1790. Potash is made of potassium carbonate.

## CDC - Mining - Catastrophic Failures of Underground Evaporite Mines - NIOSH
Deformation of underground salt, trona and potash mines is generally time dependent, providing for gradual adjustment of strata to mining induced stresses. Time dependence can allow for higher extraction ratios provided eventual failure can be tolerated. However, this eventual failure can be violent if creep deformation can shift stress and

## Potash Mining and Processing Infographic | eKonomics
Potassium bearing minerals are mined from underground ore deposits or extracted from salt lakes and brines. (e.g. Great Salt Lake, Utah and the Dead Sea). These deposits were formed as ancient oceans evaporated, leaving behind concentrated salt layers that were subsequently buried by sediment. Most potash mines today are deep shaft mines.
