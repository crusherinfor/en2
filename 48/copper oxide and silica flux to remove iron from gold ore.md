## Aluminiumrbauernhof-boernicke
Aluminium (chemical symbol Al; atomic number 13) is a poor metal, also called a "post-transition metal". Like the other poor metals, it is soft. Aluminium has low density (is "light") and is a good thermal and electrical conductor. As a result, aluminium is widely used in vehicle and plane construction, drinks cans and power lines. The popularity of aluminum has expanded to many

## Flux (metallurgy)
In metallurgy, a flux (derived from Latin fluxus meaning "flow") is a chemical cleaning agent, flowing agent, or purifying agent. Fluxes may have more than one function at a time. They are used in both extractive metallurgy and metal joining. Some of the earliest known fluxes were sodium carbonate, potash, charcoal, coke, borax, lime, lead sulfide and certain minerals containing phosphorus.

This method improves the natural oxidation properties of aluminum that leaves a non-reactive layer of aluminum oxide to make the aluminum stronger and less reactive. Hard anodization also improves the resistance of the aluminum metal when exposed to extreme heat. The treated hard anodized aluminum holds up better and is less likely to warp.

## copper oxide and silica flux to remove iron from gold ore
 · To remove FeO (basic), the roasted ore is mixed with silica and heated. Silica acts as a flux and combines with ferrous oxide present to form fusible slag of iron silicate. The slag being lighter floats and forms the upper layer and is removed through slag hole. Therefore, silica helps to remove FeO in the metallurgy of copper.
