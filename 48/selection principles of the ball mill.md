## Ball milling as a mechanochemical technology for fabrication of novel 
Mechanochemical technique aims to strike a balance between defect formation via ball milling and size adjustment of a solid grain to nanoscale (<1000 nm) (Ullah et al., 2014).During the process, a high-energy mill is employed and a specific powder charge is placed along with a milling medium (Lin et al., 2017).The kinetic energy generated during the motion of moving balls is applied to the

## Ball Mill - SlideShare
Basic principle Ball mill is generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer, down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills, they must be operated in a closed system. There is a specific operating speed for most efficient grinding. At a certain point, controlled by the mill speed, the load
