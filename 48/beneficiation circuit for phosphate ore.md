## Beneficiation of Phosphate Ore - Google Books
Beneficiation of Phosphate Ore examines various methods for processing phosphate rock, an important mineral commodity used in the production of phosphoric acid. The majority of phosphoric acid is produced by the wet process, in which phosphate rock is reacted with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid and gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate).

## Electrostatic Beneficiation of Phosphate Ores: Review of Past Work|
Abstract. Beneficiation of phosphate ores by dry electrostatic processes has been attempted by various researchers since the 1940's. The underlying reasons for developing dry processes for phosphate recovery are the limited amount of water in some arid regions, the flotation chemical costs, and the wastewater treatment costs.

## Beneficiation
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product (ore concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.
