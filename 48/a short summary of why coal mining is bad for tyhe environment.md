## Coal: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly - Civic Issues
The more carbon the coal has the better it burns and the less byproduct it produces. Coal saw its rise during the industrial revolution and has grown ever since as a primary energy source. This is primarily due to the innate nature of coal. It is a sedimentary rock and is therefore easily exposed by weathering and can be effectively mined.

## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Destruction and poison linger. Bad mining practices can ignite coal fires, which can burn for decades, release fly ash and smoke laden with greenhouse gasses and toxic chemicals. Furthermore mining releases coal mine methane, a greenhouse gas 20 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.

Coal mining increases the risk of loosening top soils into streams and waterways and the sediments pollute our water and can smother plant life downstream and even kill fish. Coal has traces of sulfur and nitrogen. When burned, these are released into the atmosphere.

## Impact of Mining On The Environment
The impact of mining is leading to the major issues, like a threat to the entire environment and also damaging the health of all life on Earth. Mining procedures generally require a larger and vast area of land. Deforestation is a by-product of mining and the build up of the mining areas requires constructing roads and residences for the mine

## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Coal Industry?
The coal industry has a significantly negative environmental impact on the land, water, and air. It is responsible for producing pollution such as ash, sludge, slurry, arsenic, mercury, uranium, and other heavy metals that pollute the air and waterways. Additionally, coal processing has a negative effect on human health.

Coal mining can cause a number of environmental issues in the immediate area of mining - land degradation, damage to wildlife and their habitats, and water pollution. It can also displace local communities. In some parts of the world, coal mining also has harmful working conditions and can lead to human health problems (such as 'black lung').

## Why is coal so bad for the environment? - Short-Facts
Oct 8, 2020Burning coal emits large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Coal is composed almost entirely of carbon, so burning coal unleashes large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. These emissions have been shown to increase the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere and lead to global warming.
