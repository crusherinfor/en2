## An Explanation of How Limestone Caves are Formed at Every Stage
Limestone is a sedimentary rock mainly composed of calcium carbonate and calcite formed by marine organisms like coral, shellfish and algae. It holds up to 10% of the total volume of the sedimentary rocks. A pure limestone is white in color, however, with impurities like sand, minerals and clay, limestones are found in different colors too.
