## Understanding Limestone in Cement - Concrete Construction
The added limestone in the U.S. is modern portland cement and consists of ground clinker, a source of readily soluble sulfates and functional additives. The change is that the specification adds up to 5% limestone. The biggest difference in production is that the limestone is added to the clinker blend before grinding.
