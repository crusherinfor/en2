## Manufacturing Process of Steel - Properties Fabrication Uses
The furnace gets its name from the method that is used to heat it. Pre-heated air at about 1000 o C is blasted into the furnace through nozzles near its base. There are two process routes for making steel today: the electric arc furnace and the basic oxygen converter. The latter requires a charge of molten iron, which is produced in blast furnaces.

The production process of silico manganese goes through stages such as smelting, and slag formationandreduction. Here is the detailed discussion on the stages: Stage 1: It revolves round heating and pre reduction in the solid state at 1373 K and 1473 K. The manganese oxide content is reduced to manganese monoxide and iron oxides to metallic iron.
