## Ground Collapse: Old mines and prospects and sinkholes - NC
Building above an abandoned mine can be dangerous if the mine is weak or near the ground surface. On Feb. 18, 2000, a collapse hole developed in the front yard of a house in Cabarrus County (Figure 21). The hole was above the old Phoenix Gold Mine, which closed in 1906. In the 1980s a suburban golf course community was built over the mine.
