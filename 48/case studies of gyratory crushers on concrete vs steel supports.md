## What is a Gyratory Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
The gyratory crusher can work continuously in a full cavity without a feeding device. It can directly feed materials to the gyratory crusher by multiple vehicles, so the production capacity is large ( t/h), the unit energy consumption is small, and the work is stable. The noise is small.

The KB pistons have shown improvement in power, fuel economy, cylinder sealing, service life, and cost effectiveness. NOTE::: (The reduced thermal expansion rate allows the piston to be run with reduced clearance.) A tight piston is less likely to rock, make noise, and burn oil.
