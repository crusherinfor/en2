## Ball Mill Linings | Multotec
How does a ball mill work? Ball mill grinders work on the principle of impact and attrition. The ball mill machine contains a hollow cylindrical shell that rotates around its axis, becoming a tumbling ball mill. The impact of the balls that drop from the top of the shell therefore reduce the size of the material at the bottom of the shell.
