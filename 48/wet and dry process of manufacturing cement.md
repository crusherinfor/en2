Advantages: The wet process of cement production has the characteristics of simple operation, low dust and easy transport. The slurry has good fluidity, good homogeneity, and the quality of the clinker is improved. In addition, the energy consumption of raw material grinding in wet processes is reduced by almost 30%.

## Cement Manufacturing Process: How the Cement is Made?
All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.

## How Portland Cement is Made? Manufacturing Process of Portland Cement
Portland cement can be made by following two different processes - a dry one and a wet one. Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th century. Lime and silica make up approximately 85% of portland cement. The materials that are commonly used are limestone, shells, chalk, shale, clay, slate, silica sand, and iron ore.

Various stages of dry process of manufacturing cement are described below: 1. Crushing & Storage The limestone and clay are ground separately to a size of about 25 mm in crushers. Then it is pulverized into fine powder in ball mills and tube mills. The crushing and pulverizing process is carried out separately for each material.

## Why Choose Dry Process From Manufacturing Cement Methods
The wet process method is manufacturing raw materials slurry with 32%-40% water content. Wet process method's advantage is that its good fluidity of raw materials slurry makes more even mixed materials and produces high-quality clinker. But it requires more heat consumption, so it is environment-friendly. Flow-of-Cement-Manufacturing-Process

Dry mix or wet concrete for ballast box. So I'm about to fill my semi-custom ballast box, and am debating whether to fill with dry mix, or go through the routine of mixing the concrete with water. Dry concrete mix is about pounds per cubic foot (assumes minimal air), whereas wet mix ends up curing at 145 pounds per cubic foot.
