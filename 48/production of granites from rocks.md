## HOW IS GRANITE FORMED? - European Granite
Jul 31, 2021Granite is an intrusive igneous rock, which means it was formed in place during the cooling of molten rock. Generally, the slower the molten rock cooled, the larger it's mineral crystals with K-Feldspar megacrysts forming in special circumstances greater than 5cm.  The production of granite by metamorphic heat is difficult, but is observed

## Granite Characteristics - PerfectGranite
The term granite is derived from the Latin word granum meaning grain. It is full of small and large grains of crystals. This stone starts out as a molten mass of magma and then forms into the rock granite as this magma cools. usually over millions of years. Granites are classified differently in scientific and industry terms.

However, the densities and velocities reported for those rock by Schock and others (1972) are notably higher than from the Karkaralinsk granites. Acknowledgements.

During formation of granite it is buried below kilometers of rock and sediment necessary to produce enough heat to melt rock. Of course, the granite we see today is near surface, and thus at some point was uplifted, causing overlying sediment to be shed via erosion.

Granites are widely occurring felsic, intrusive and igneous type of rocks. The texture of granite is medium to coarse, rarely with some crystals bigger than the groundmass forming rock which is called as porphyry. Granites are found in different colors like pink, dark gray, green, yellow, red or sometimes even in black and gold depending upon its mineralogy and chemistry.

Igneous rock is the one that is formed when molten rock or magma cools off and hardens. The term "intrusive" means that the rock coagulated beneath the Earth's surface after it was initially imposed into other rocks. The average density of granite is 2.75 g•cm −3 with a series of 1.74 g•cm −3 to 2.80 g•cm −3.

## Petrogenesis of felsic I-type granites: an example from northern 
Felsic I-type granites and associated volcanic rocks of Carboniferous age are extensively developed over an area of 15,000 km 2 in northern Queensland. These granites have been subdivided into four supersuites: Almaden, Claret Creek, Ootann and O'Briens Creek.  In High heat production (HHP) granites, hydrothermal circulation and ore genesis

## Granite
Granite (/ ˈ ɡ r æ n ə t /) is a coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase.It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. It is common in the continental crust of Earth, where it is found in igneous intrusions.These range in size from dikes only a few centimeters
