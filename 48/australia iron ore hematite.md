## Iron Ore - Weebly
Iron Ore is a rock or mineral which iron can be extracted from. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, deep purple, to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite, hematite, goethite, limonite or siderite.About 3000 million years ago there was no or very little oxygen dissolved in the oceans, because plants that

## Types of Iron Ore: Hematite vs. Magnetite
Aug 31, 2022Hematite ore has been the main type of iron ore mined in Australia since the early 1960s. Almost all of Australia's iron ore exports are high-grade hematite ore, and most of its reserves are in The Hammersley Range in Western Australia because the range sits on a banded iron formation.

Hematite. Hematite is an iron ore that contains iron in the form of Fe 2 O 3. It is a significant source of iron extraction. Hematite is a mineral that is paramagnetic. As a result, it can be drawn to an external magnetic field. Hematite is abundant in rocks and soil. Hematite's magnetic properties are caused by unpaired electrons.
