## The Influence of Ceramic Ball as a Fine Aggregate in Concrete
Sep 3, 2021Specific gravity for the ceramic ball is 2.75 and sand is 2.55 which is nearly similar, and hence, the ceramic ball can be used as a substitute for sand in concrete. The characteristic strength of the M30 concrete mix is 38.25 MPa. The strength in 30% replacement is 33.85 MPa. Hence, waste samples can be used to replace 30% sand in fine aggregate.

The raw fine bone china aggregates were evaluated for pozzolanic activity using the Frattini test, saturated lime test, and strength activity index test. The compressive strength results showed that up to 60% of the fine bone china ceramic aggregate (FBCCA) can be used to produce concrete with desirable strength characteristics.

## Effect of Crushed Waste Ceramic Tiles (CWCT) as Partial Replacement for 
In their study, ceramic tile waste was used in the concrete as a replacement for natural coarse aggregate with (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) of the substitution and M20 grade concrete were used. The concrete moulds were cast and tested for compressive strength and split tensile strength after a curing period of 3, 7 and 28 days.
