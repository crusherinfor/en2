## KAOLINITE (Aluminum Silicate Hydroxide)
Kaolinite, which is named for its type locality, Kao-Ling, Jianxi, China; is a common phyllosilicate mineral. It lends it name to the Kaolinite Group, members of which also belong to the larger general group known as the Clays. Kaolinite's structure is composed of silicate sheets (Si 2 O 5) bonded to aluminum oxide/hydroxide layers (Al 2 (OH) 4) called gibbsite layers.

The main commercially important kaolin resources are the primary deposits in Cornwall and the sedimentary deposits in South Carolina and Georgia in the U.S.A. Annual world production is about 18 Mt (1 t = 10 3 kg). In 1981 the U.K. production was 2.6 x 10 6 t of which about 77 % represented paper filler and paper coating grades. About 15% of the U.K. production is used in ceramics.
