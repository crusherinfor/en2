This process is known to purify gold to 99.95%. This method got its name from Francis Bowyer Miller, its inventor. In the Miller process, unrefined gold is first melted. Then, chlorine gas is passed through it. The gas turns other metals and impurities into a solid form, making it easy to separate them from gold.

Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## How gold is made - history, used, parts, procedure, industry, machine 
Gold, recognizable by its yellowish cast, is one of the oldest metals used by humans. As far back as the Neolithic period, humans have collected gold from stream beds, and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 B.C., when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry, religious artifacts, and utensils such as goblets.

Refining is the process of purifying an impure metal. It's easiest to think of precious metals refining as a method of recycling. The refining process takes products or byproducts containing precious metals (such as jewelry or dental scrap) and isolates the metals back into more purified states for recirculation.

 The two gold refining methods most commonly employed to derive pure gold are: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process. The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold.

The refining procedure is then completed by placing the ingots (anodes) in vats containing a nitric acid solution and applying an electric charge. The ingot dissolves and the silver content is plated out on a cathode plate. The resulting silver crystal is removed from the cell, washed, dried, and melted into the desired shape as pure silver.
