## 7 ways oil and gas drilling is bad for the environment
3. Oil and gas development can ruin wildlands. Infrastructure built for oil and gas extraction can leave behind radical impacts on wildlands. The construction of roads, facilities and drilling sites requires the use of heavy equipment and can destroy big chunks of pristine wilderness. The damage is often irreversible.

Abstract. Demonstration or commercial gravity drainage oil mining projects are currently operating in the US and the USSR, and extractive techniques are being used in Canada. A review of reservoirs in 60 free world countries indicates potential candidates for oil mining in most of the petroleum producing regions.

Coal Mining Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. Once coal has been extracted, it can be used directly (for heating and industrial processes) or to fuel power plants for electricity. Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining.

## Formation, Occurrence, Extraction and Refining of coal and petroleum.
Petroleum does not occur in all the places of earth. It is found only in certain places of earth. Natural gas occurs just above the petroleum oil trapped under the rocks. 7. Extraction Extraction of coal Coal is extracted through deep shaft mining in which very deep holes are made to reach the ore lying at a great beneath the crust.

## Sunflower oil extraction ratioes-lifestyle
How to improve the extraction efficiency of the oil will expand the use of the resource. In this paper, the four extraction factors, particle size of In addition, two steps were conducted for refining the oil extract technology. In the first step, three comparatively ideal levels of the four factors were obtained.

## Coal and Petroleum - Types and Conservation - VEDANTU
Coal is taken out from the earth by the process of underground mining or surface mining. We burn coal to get energy. Coal is mostly used as a domestic fuel to make food in rural areas.  It is a very useful energy source. However, the petroleum extracted from oil wells is not in a directly usable form. It is impure and, therefore, called

## Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction: NAICS 21
The mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector is part of the natural resources and mining supersector. The Mining sector comprises establishments that extract naturally occurring mineral solids, such as coal and ores; liquid minerals, such as crude petroleum; and gases, such as natural gas. The term mining is used in the broad sense
