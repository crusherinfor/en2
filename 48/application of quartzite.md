## The Ultimate Guide to Quartzite Countertops | Rock Doctor
Due to its density, quartzite rarely needs to be sealed. While some contractors will say quartzite doesn't require any sealing, the occasional application of a sealer will prevent any potential damage. Staining is less likely with quartzite, however. Even though quartzite is durable, it isn't indestructible.

## Quartzite - Formation, Composition, Properties, and Uses
Quartzite (from German Quarzit) forms when quartz sandstones are metamorphosed. The term quartzite also implies its high quartz content. Most quartzites contain 90% quartz by volume, but the percentage can go up to 99% in the case of the purest quartzite forms. Quartzite looks similar to its parent rock but it is much harder than sandstone.
