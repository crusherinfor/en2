Beasley River, located near Tom Price in Western Australia, is an inferred resource of approximately 400 million tonnes of pisolitic ore. The geographical and geological characteristics of the Beasley River deposit complement and enhance the pisolite resources available to the Robe participants at Pannawonica and elsewhere in the Robe valley.

## Oolites, Pisolites and Laterites Formation and Composition - BohatALA
A pisolite is a sedimentary rock made of pisoids, which are concretionary grains - often of calcium carbonate, but sometimes of rarer minerals - which resemble ooids but are always more than 2 mm in diameter. These grains are approximately spherical and have concentric layers reaching 10 mm in diameter.

So far, that has not been happening at Robe River. Having gained 50% equity in Robe River, Peko Wallsend management appears to have its sights firmly set on increasing profits in the face of a slump in world market prices for iron ore. To do that, it needs to dramatically increase productivity.

## The origin of terrestrial pisoliths and pisolitic iron ore deposits 
Pisolitic iron ores (aka channel iron deposits, CID) are a special case of transported pisolitic ferricrust that form an important resource of medium grade iron ore (57-60 wt% Fe) in the Pilbara Region of Western Australia. Apart from minor deposits in the northern Yilgarn Province of Western Australia, they have not been found elsewhere.

Two years previous to the publication of this report Sherlock 1918 had described the pyritic ores of Trefriw and had concluded that they are probably a highly metamorphosed pisolitic iron ore of Nemagraptus gracilis age. The Geological Survey Memoir on Anglesey Greenly 1919 gave an account of the oolitic iron ores of the island.
