An elliptical motion is created by an eccentric shaft passing through the top of the jawstock which pivots around a toggle plate at the lower half of the jawstock. This geometry turns the rotary motion of the eccentric shaft into a fore aft motion at the bottom of the jaw plate creating the crushing action.

Talcum powder works great as a silicone mold release agent, but on molds that have fewer details. For example, a half-sphere mold or gem-shaped mold. Talcum powder does not work with solid or hard molds or molds with more details. This is because the powder does not cover the mold properly, so it wont prevent the resin from sticking to these areas.

However, there are many exceptions to this general rule. A Jaw Crusher reduces large size rocks or ore by placing the rock into compression. A fixed jaw, mounted in a "V" alignment is the stationary breaking surface, while the movable jaw exerts force on the rock by forcing it against the stationary plate.

## Everything about jaw crushers - what are they and how do they work 
How do jaw crushers work? A jaw crusher uses compressive force to break large sized materials into smaller and more usable pieces. With two jaws in action (one stationary and the other moving), jaw crushers create mechanical pressure which is potent enough to crush objects as solid as hard rocks.

The jaw crusher reduces the size of large rocks by dropping them into a "V"-shaped mouth at the top of the crusher chamber. This is created between one fixed rigid jaw and a pivoting swing jaw set at acute angles to each other. Compression is created by forcing the rock against the stationary plate in the crushing chamber as shown in Fig. 13.9.
