## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

## 8 Types of Gold Ore- Properties and Ways to Process
Once you find gold in quartz ore, you can extract gold by the flowing steps: 1 Use a sledgehammer to break the rock into smaller pieces. 2 Place a steel anvil in a large pan to prevent the loss of the gold contained in the quartz stone. 3 Look for large pieces of gold that can be collected manually or with tweezers.

The dissolution or extraction of gold from gold ore is an electrochemical reaction. Gold extraction generally involves two electrochemical reactions [8 ]: (2.7.16) (2.7.17) After the gold is dissolved, it is concentrated by carbon adsorption. Later, it is recovered from solution as metallic gold by electrolysis.

Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.
