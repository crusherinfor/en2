Large concrete blocks. In some cases, partition blocks of 25 cm and thicker are used. As the weight of each piece goes over 30 Kg in normal weight concrete, it become very heavy to handle and execution works get delayed considerably. Lightweight concrete blocks decreases the weigh to 18 Kg and less per piece, resulting in less labor and cost.

## What Are Lightweight Blocks & What Are They Used For? - Al Manaratain
As previously mentioned, Al Manaratain lightweight blocks are useful for many internal and external building applications. Due to their heat and moisture resistance, thermal and sound insulation, and top-class fire rating, they are frequently used in the construction of exterior walls in place of regular concrete blocks or bricks.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.
