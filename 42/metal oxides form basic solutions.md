## Why are metal oxides basic? - Quora
Answer (1 of 15): Oxides of elements give hydroxides of the form A-O-H in aqueous solutions. The species produced on ionisation depends on electronegativity differences. Here's the principle: the bond across which the atoms have greater electronegativity difference, that is, bond with greater io

## Is oxide a metal?145
Metals tend to form basic oxides, non-metals tend to form acidic oxides, and amphoteric oxides are formed by elements near the boundary between metals and non-metals  And similarly the metal oxides also produce OH- ions in the aqueous solution. That's why metal oxides are also known as the basic oxides. Is co2 acidic or basic oxide?

## Magnesium oxide
Magnesium oxide (Mg O), or magnesia, is a white hygroscopic solid mineral that occurs naturally as periclase and is a source of magnesium (see also oxide).It has an empirical formula of MgO and consists of a lattice of Mg 2+ ions and O 2− ions held together by ionic bonding. Magnesium hydroxide forms in the presence of water (MgO + H 2 O → Mg(OH) 2), but it can be reversed by heating it to

A general property of metal oxides is that they tend to react with water to form basic solutions of the metal hydroxide. For example BaO is a basic oxide. It dissolves in water to form barium hydroxide, Ba(OH) 2. The solution contains "1" Ba 2+ ion for every "2" hydroxide ions, OH 1-. This means one firmula unit forms the following ions.

## 12.2 The general reaction of an acid with a metal oxide
Non-metal oxides tend to form acidic solutions when they dissolve in water. These solutions will have pH values below 7. Metal oxides, metal hydroxides and metal carbonates form basic solutions in water; these will have pH values above 7. When a metal oxide, or a metal hydroxide reacts with an acid, a salt and water form as products.
