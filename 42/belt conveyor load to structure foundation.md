Even in the higher zones the customer only wants the structures to meet seismic and the conveyors not. The justification is that the conveyors are "low risk" to human life and are highly redundant so when designed for wind they will survive most shakes. Also consider the return interval for quake design and the life expectancy of your structure.

## Belt Conveyor Design Load - Structural engineering general discussion 
The conveyor manufacturer should be able to supply the information about the conveyor itself and the rated loading. You should also ask for the belt tension for design of the end supports. As for design of the support system, after you have the conveyor details, that is standard structural engineering work. Caljan123 (Materials) 22 Aug 12 08:48.

## Design of Pad Foundation - Structville
Pad foundation is a category 2 structure, and this design is to be done using prescriptive methods: Let 10% of the service load account for the self-weight of the pad foundation. Base area A = 1.1 (800 + 425)/225 = 5.99 m 2. Minimum dimensions of footing = âˆš5.99 = 2.447m.
