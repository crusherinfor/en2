## Cost Evaluation of Producing Different Aggregate Sizes in Selected 
In order to achieve the aim of this research physical properties of aggregate and stages involve in aggregate production were discussed. Also, structured questionnaires were distributed to the mangers and other management staff in the selected quarries to acquire the total cost implication of producing 1 ton of granite aggregate.
