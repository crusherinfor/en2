## The Effects Of Temperature On Concrete During Installation (PICP)
Temperatures during the manufacture and placing of concrete can affect its setting time and final strength. When temperatures are high, this can lead to cracks, and many mass concrete works use chilled water for the mixing process to control the temperature of the concrete and reduce the chances of cracking and damage.
