Experienced gravel suppliers advise using crushed stone beneath the concrete to deter water accumulation. The stone crevices provide an easy exit route for water, preventing it from pooling under the concrete. Moreover, crushed stone adds a protective underlayment that keeps water from touching the concrete slab. 3. Prevent Concrete Cracks.

## Can I Make Concrete with Just Sand and Cement? (What To Do) - Gizmo Plans
The reason concrete cannot be made simply by mixing sand with cement is that it is a composite material that needs a coarse aggregate to achieve this strength. In essence, concrete is a mixture of Portland cement, water, sand, and rocks. The cement or paste coats and binds the sand and rocks. Then, a chemical reaction called hydration, which is

A combination of 3/8 crushed stone and washed sand. The source of crushed sand is a quarry. It is manufactured by crushing rock, quarry stones or larger aggregate pieces into sand size particles in a factory or quarry. The compressive strength as well as the flexural strength of concrete made from crushed sand is higher than natural sand.
