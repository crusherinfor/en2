## Iron ore fluxed pellets and their physical properties
The crushing strength of the fluxed pellets produced increased with increasing the amount of bentonite addition. This is because, as stated before, the cementing action of bentonite improved the resistance of pellets to breakage- This is particularly noticeable in the case of limestone pellets as well as fluxed iron ore pellets.

In general, higher purity ores help increase hot metal yields in the blast furnace, and also lower production cost by reducing the amount of coke required. For these reasons, the rule of thumb is "higher Fe grade, higher price.". Iron ore also differs in physical form. Fines require sintering (agglomeration into crude pellets) prior to use

## Solving iron ore quality issues for low-carbon steel | IEEFA
DRI-electric arc furnace (EAF) technology is proven and in use today. However, it requires high-quality iron ore (DR-grade) with iron (Fe) content of 67% and above, which has lower levels of impurities. DR-grade iron ore currently makes up only about 4% of global iron ore supply. Some fossil fuel-based steelmaking supply chain incumbents

## Increasing The Durability Of Pellet Iron Ore
Lotta Casey Organic Binders For Iron Ore. Agglomerating iron ore in general use for blast furnaces. pelletizing is commonly used when the ore needs to be shipped great distances to the blast furnace due to the better durability of pellets [5, 6]. the pelletization procedure consists of agglomerating the ore powder into "green" balls.

## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview - IntechOpen
Iron ore and iron ore pellets are important sources of iron for manufacturing steel. The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years, owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries, such as China and India. However, the content of iron ore in deposits has deteriorated and low-grade iron ore has been processed.

## Iron Ore with Lime Pelletizing Case Study - Clariant Ltd.
Increasing iron ore pellet throughput without adding plant equipment can result in challenges to maintain product quality when using a hydrated lime binding agent alone. This was the experience of a blast furnace pellet producer when increasing its pellet production. The producer approached Clariant to develop a pelletizing additive that would
