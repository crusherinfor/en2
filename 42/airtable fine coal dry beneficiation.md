## COKING COAL BENEFICIATION | SciTech Connect - Elsevier
The first step of Beneficiation is to crush or grind the coal to liberate the coaly matter from ashy matter which can theoretically yield complete liberation. In the case of intergrown texture, finer grinding up to a few micron size is necessary for complete liberation whereas for free dirt ordinary crushing is sufficient (Kumar, D., 1982).

## Coal beneficiation: Policy priorities for India | ORF
Coal Beneficiation is a process where coal is subjected to a medium of defined specific gravity. Heavier material sinks (rejects) and lighter coal floats (clean coal). This specific gravity is defined by the 'washability' characteristics of the coal seam. It varies for different seams in the same area and for different geographical areas.

## Dry beneficiation of coal fines using air table - eprints@NML
Aug 9, 2022Wet processing of coal requires a large quantity of water. Waste generated from wet process ties up a significant amount of water and land.

## Mechanism and application of coal dry beneficiation with air-dense 
The mechanism of beneficiation with air-dense fluidized bed has been theoretically studied in the paper. Focusing attention on the misplacing resources in separation process, the misplacing effects are divided into two parts called respectively as misplacing effect of viscosity and misplacing effect of motion. The proposed separation theory can reasonably explain the results of separation in
