## Polyurethane Belts - Reveyron
The TPU belts contribute to substantial savings and optimise industrial processes, allowing you to boost productivity and performance of your conveyor systems with longer preventive maintenance intervals and less unplanned downtimes. The belts provide a longer service life and a reduced energy consumption.

## Understanding Conveyor Systems - Types, Applications and  - Thomasnet
Conveyor Systems are mechanical devices or assemblies that transport material with minimal effort. While there are many different kinds of conveyor systems, they usually consist of a frame that supports either rollers, wheels, or a belt, upon which materials move from one place to another. They may be powered by a motor, by gravity, or manually

Depending on the material on the conveyor belt, fire can accelerate very rapidly, resulting in extensive damage. Bearing failures can be very expensive both in terms of direct damage costs but also the downtime required to repair and replace. For example, an 8km conveyor belt for copper/molybendum mine can extract $320,000 per hour .

When pulling the belt onto the system, station personnel at key points along the conveyor to help avoid the belt from hanging up on the structure resulting in belt damage. Pull the belt ends until they overlap the required splicing length. Fig. 4. To prevent the belt roll from over-running at the let-off, a braking device is often needed (Fig. 4).

A conveyor belt works by using two motorized pulleys that loop over a long stretch of thick, durable material.
