## Production of Coal in Germany, 2017 - 2025 (Million Tonnes)
The coal market will be analyzed taking coal mining companies as players. The key buyers will be taken as power generation companies, and mining equipment suppliers and landowners/regulators as the key suppliers. Coal is Germany's most abundant indigenous energy resource. However, its consumption has been historically decreasing over time.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
