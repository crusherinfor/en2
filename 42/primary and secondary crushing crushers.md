The degree to which material is reduced through stages of primary, secondary, and tertiary crushing can depend on the type of material, like aggregate, concrete, and asphalt, and can also depend on the variety of output sizes needing produced. Primary crushing is the first stage of material reduction and can sometimes be the only stage needed
