Where Is Limestone Mined? Limestone is most often mined from a quarry. However underground limestone mines are found at places in the central and eastern United States especially in and near cities. Underground mining of lime- stone has some advantages over surface quarrying and will probably increase in the future.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

The limestone samples were subjected to elemental analysis by Proton-Induced X-Ray Emission (PIXE) analysis. The samples were irradiated by a 4mm diameter beam of protons with energy of 2.5 MeV and beam current of 0.2nA for 0.9 ms.
