Apr 28, 2022Metallurgy is the process of extracting pure metal from its ore. Naturally, most of the metals are found in their combined state. So it becomes essential to extract the pure form of metal for various other domestic and commercial purposes. Minerals from which metals can be easily extracted are called Ores.

## Extraction of Metals - Minerals, Ores & Iron Extraction Process
Electropositive metals like those of group 1 and group 2 are extracted through this process. Extraction of metals is a complicated process and sometimes involves two or more processes to extract the pure element from its ore. The extraction of iron from its ore is an important topic for both class 12th board and JEE. it is explained as follows:

## Extraction of Metals - Methods of Extraction of Metals from Ores - BYJUS
The extraction of metals and their isolation occurs over a few major steps: Concentration of Ore - Here the ore is separated from earthy impurities. Isolation of metal from concentrated Ore - Here the ore is converted to its oxide form and then reduced. The steps involved are either calcination or roasting and then heating with a reducing

## Extraction of Metals: Methods, Processes Involved, Minerals, and Ores
May 7, 2021On passing the current through the electrolyte, the pure metal from the anode dissolves into the electrolyte. An equivalent amount of pure metal from the electrolyte is deposited on the cathode. The soluble impurities go into the solution, whereas, the insoluble impurities settle down at the bottom of the anode and are known as anode mud.
