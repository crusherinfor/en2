## Making Toolpaths Terrific with Digital Twins | Better MRO
What's not in dispute is that machine shops can use digital twins to make CNC-programmed toolpaths more efficient, thus improving tool life, productivity, and part quality while eliminating surprises during the setup and machining process. The only question is how big the benefits are, and that depends on the quality of the twin.

## Grinding Machine: Definition, Parts, Working Principle, Operation 
A grinding machine is a production machine tool used in the manufacturing industry in which the grinding wheel is attached in the tool post and the workpiece is fixed to the work table and when the operation starts it removes the unwanted material to get the desired surface finish, correct size, and accurate shape of the workpiece.

Step 1: Inspection. If this is your first time, make sure you have a dressing tool and a tool rest to place it on as you dress the wheel. First and foremost, before you start dressing the grinding wheel itself, you need to take stock of your wheel and dressing tool's integrity. Be sure to check for any visual cracks on either the wheel or tool.
