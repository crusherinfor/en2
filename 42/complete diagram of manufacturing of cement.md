The concrete not to pour over a height of 1.5m. As the height of pouring concrete increases, it leads to separation of aggregates and cement paste. It causes segregation of concrete and causes honeycomb. Many concrete placing equipment use in modern construction times. some of the equipment are concrete pumps and boom lifts.

## Manufacturing of Portland Cement - Process and Materials
The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of

## Cement manufacturing - components of a cement plant
Cement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale. These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions. This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln feed' and is heated in a rotary kiln where it reaches a temperature of about 1400 C to 1500 C.
