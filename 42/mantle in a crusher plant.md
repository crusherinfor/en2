The mantle is where the magic happens inside of a cone crusher. The mantle is made from steel or iron, and it's shaped similarly to a lampshade. The end of the mantle connects to the crusher's motor, and when the machine is on the mantle rotates, crushing the material in the process. It's important to note that the mantle rotates eccentrically.
