Pool grade diatomaceous earth is the only form of DE that can present a health risk. Pool grade diatomaceous earth is made by heating normal diatomaceous earth to temperatures in excess of 1000 degrees celsius. This treatment causes the silica in the DE to crystallize, creating a highly efficient pool filter.
