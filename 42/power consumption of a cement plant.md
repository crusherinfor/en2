## Energy efficiency - VDZ
Energy efficiency. The cement industry is one of the energy-intensive sectors in Germany, with an energy input of around 30 TWh per annum (fuels + electricity) and energy costs amounting to more than 30% of gross value added. For this reason, all the cement plants in Germany are constantly working to optimise the efficiency of their

Oct 02, 2020· Cement grinding plant is the last station in the cement production line. Its power consumption accounts for 65% - 75% of the whole cement plant. Therefore, reducing the energy consumption in the cement grinding process is of great significance for energy conservation and emission reduction of the cement manufacturing plant.

## Energy Consumption in Production of Concrete - Geoplast
The production of 1 m³ of concrete requires 2,775 MJ of energy. This energy comes mostly from oil burning, which generates CO2. 2.775 MJ of energy is produced by 0.37 barrels of oil. Saving concrete, e.g. by adopting appropriate building solutions, means therefore not only reducing fossil fuels consumption, but also pollutant emissions.
