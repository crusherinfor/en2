A gyratory crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. Gyratory crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening. Gyratory crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing. Major components can be divided to ease transport

Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and further developed by Gates in 1881 (they were commonly referred to as a 'Gate's crushers' in the early years). A primary crusher is designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly from the mines. Gyratory crushers typically crush to reduce the size of aggregate to a maximum

## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The gyratory crushers crush to reduce the size by a maximum of about one-tenth its size. Usually, metallurgical operations require greater size reduction; hence, the products from the primary crushers are conveyed to secondary or cone crushers where further reduction in size takes place. Here, the maximum reduction ratio is about 8:1.

A primary gyratory crusher was required to crush iron ore at the rate of 3000 t/h. The largest size of the run-of-mine ore was 1000 mm. The required product size was less than 162 mm. Manufacturer's data indicated that the nearest size of gyratory crusher would be 1370 mm × 1880 mm with a cone angle of 18°.

The size that the crusher will reduce the rock to is determined by the gap between the liner and the mantle. This gap is adjusted by moving the bowl liner away from the mantle. The closer to the mantle the smaller the gap. The bowl liner is adjusted the same way that a nut is put onto a bolt. The liner is turned on a set of threads.

A lump of lead, whose dimensions are greater than the gap of the crusher, is lowered through the crusher while the crusher is running. The lead is pulled back through the crusher very slowly to be sure that it is flattened as far as it can be. The narrowest point on the lead is then measured. This will be the SET POINT of the crusher.
