## Disadvantages of crushed sand in concrete
Crushed Sand vs. Natural Sand: Make the Right Choice! Crushed sand can be of coarser and angular texture. This can lead to more water and cement requirement to achieve the expected workability. Crushed sand contains a larger amount of micro- fine particles. This can affect the strength of concrete.

## Opportunities and limitations of concrete recycling
In contrast, this stage has not been reached yet in building construction. For instance, an average of only 1.2 million t of crushed concrete is currently converted to recycled aggregates for use in concrete production. This figure corresponds to a share of 2.2% in the total volume of reprocessed construction waste.

Crushed concrete requires little, if any, maintenance and can last forever! Since it is a loose gravel-like material, you won't have to worry about it cracking in heat or frost or when the soil shifts (unlike concrete slabs). However, crushed concrete will settle over time, so you may want to add a new layer when you see that the level is dropping.

History. Recycled concrete aggregates or Crushed concrete aggregates has been in use since the ancient times, only to be integrated with gravel, sand, and cement to ensure durability. The practice was first recorded in the 1860s. US construction companies were reluctant to use the technique at first since crushing cured concrete proved to be much more cost-intensive in terms of labor.

## Crushed concrete vs limestone for driveway - Heavy Equipment Forums
You will always have some iron in the crushed concrete. The very nature of crushed concrete will allow some weather degradation. It tends to have a bunch of air space in the "stones." This does have the possibility to collect water, and then freeze, breaking the material down. This very downside leads to a big upside when it comes coverage.

## Why & How to Use Recycled Crushed Concrete - Superior Groundcover
It's recycling! Recycling crushed concrete to be reused helps reduce landfill crowding AND saves more resources from being used to create new concrete. Old concrete can be crushed down to specific sizes, cleaned so that unwanted debris is removed from the mixture, and reused as a solution to a number of construction and landscaping problems.
