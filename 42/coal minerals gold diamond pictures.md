## How Does Coal Become a Diamond? Excavating the Truth
Conversion of coal to diamonds is a natural process that takes millions of years. Even though there are carbon atoms in coal, the amount of impurities are so high, that it takes millions and millions of years for the coal to transform to its nearly purest form - graphite. The conversion of graphite to diamonds takes some more millions of years.
