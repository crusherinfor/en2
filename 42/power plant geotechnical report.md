The power plant was built in the 50s and 60s with four 250MW blocks. It was shut down in 2014 and is undergoing decommissioning now. The power plant burnt coal from mines in the nearby area and had a long conveyor going from the coal heaps to a nearby river pier where the coal got unloaded from the ships. I was also brought in by trains.

Self-gravity is one key parameter for behavior characterization of grout permeation and diffusion. This study proposes mathematical models for permeation grouting with consideration of grout self-gravity effect. The models concerning power law, Bingham, and Newtonian grouts are based on the generalized Darcy's law and spherical diffusion theory.
