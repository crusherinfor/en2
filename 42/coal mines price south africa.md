By 2004, the coal and lignite industry of South Africa offered more than 50,000 jobs, generating over R40 billion. About 85% of the coal production in South Africa is possible because of the top five coal mining concerns the nation has. These include South32's South Africa Energy Coal, Sasol Mining, Anglo American PLC, Exxaro and Glencore

Vast volumes of coal are transported by rail km from the export mines to the major port of Richard's Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT). The state rail company, Transnet, is responsible for almost all this movement of coal. Thozama Mokoena of North Corridor Transnet Freight Rail explained the many challenges facing the company in 2020 and 2021.

Half of reserves are in seams 4-6m thick and a further third in 2-4m seams (Petrick Commission, 1975).
