Finally, the gold-bearing carbon will be obtained by this gold separation process. Using high temperature to remove the gold in the carbon. Then the electrolysis method will be used to purify the gold during which some measure will be taken to recycle the tailing and the gold in the leaching liquid.

Panning. Panning is a gold mining method that uses water to separate the heavy gold particles from the lighter materials in the ore. When panning for gold you put your crushed gold ore in a wide pan and then add water to it. You then swirl the pan around with the aim of removing the lighter materials along with the water.

Place the remaining concentrates in the bottom of a plastic gold pan with an inch of water. Spread them out across the bottom of the pan, and hover your magnet just above them. The goal here is to actually cause the black sands to "jump" out of your gold pan.

Parting is a process by which gold is purified to a commercially-tradeable standard, typically ≥>99.5%. Removal of silver is of particular interest since the two metals often co-purify. The standard procedure is based on the Miller process. The separation is achieved by passing chlorine gas into a molten alloy.

To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.
