## Dolomite - Complete Mineral Overview
Dolomite is an anhydrous carbonate mineral composed of nominally equal parts calcium and magnesium, with the formula CaMg (CO 3) 2. Its chemical formula can be more clearly written as CaCO 3 .MgCO 3. Because of the presence of two various cations, which form regular layers inside dolomite structure, dolomite crystal symmetry is lower than calcite.

## Full Guide To Calcite vs. Quartz (This Is The Difference)
Calcite is a much softer stone compared to quartz. Quartz rates 7, while calcite rates 3 in hardness on the Mohs scale. If you're unfamiliar, the Mohs scale of hardness determines a stone's hardness by measuring how scratch-resistant it is. According to this scale, a stone can scratch any other mineral with a lower score.

## Dolomite Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
Dolomite also serves as an oil and gas reservoir rock. During the conversion of calcite to dolomite, a volume reduction occurs. This can produce pore spaces in the rock that can be filled with oil or natural gas that migrate in as they are released from other rock units. This makes the dolomite a reservoir rock and a target of oil and gas drilling.

## Granite VS Dolomite: Which One Should I Choose and What's The 
Aug 10, 2021Dolomite countertops. Dolomite, also referred to as dolostone and dolomite rock, is a sedimentary rock. By weight, it contains more than 50 percent of the mineral dolomite. Dolomite's appearance is pearly or glassy. Dolomite forms naturally when limestone undergoes a chemical change after coming in contact with magnesium-rich groundwater.

Dolomite (D) occurs as dispersed crystals with ferroan-dolomite (Df) rims. Calcite (Ca) cement sits on top of ferroan dolomite suggesting that calcite was the last carbonate cement to devlop. Gypsum cement (GA) has developed after the ferroan dolomite and calcite and this sulphate cement has here occluded most of the pores.
