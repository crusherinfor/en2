## Ore Dressing Formic Process Of Minerals
It is reported that more than 90% of non-ferrous metal ores (copper, lead, zinc, etc.) adopt flotation process, especially for those with fine grain and complex symbiosis. Flotation process can achieve ideal separation effect, and separately recover low-grade ore then enrich multiple high-grade concentrates. Different ore properties means .
