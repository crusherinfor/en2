## A Little About Applying Gold Leaf - WOODWEB
Gold leafing is an art that dates back to at least 2500 BC. This ancient decorative art began when a tiny piece of malleable precious metal was beaten down into a delicately fine sheet of gold, with a thinness of only 4 to 5 millionths of an inch. These fragile sheets of gold were overlaid onto an object, an art which became known as "gilding."
