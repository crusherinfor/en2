## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

## Mining Methods - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
MINING METHODS. The method of extracting the ore is dependent upon the nature of the ore occurrence. Each orebody is a problem in itself. All influencing factors, as size, shape, position, nature and grade of an orebody, and character of the enclosing walls, are fully considered before the method of extraction is decided.

## Silver mining
Silver mining has been undertaken since as early as the 5th century BCE. As silver is a precious metal often used for coins and bullion, its mining has historically often been lucrative. As with other precious metals such as gold or platinum, newly discovered deposits of silver ore have sparked silver rushes of miners seeking their fortunes. In recent centuries, large deposits were discovered
