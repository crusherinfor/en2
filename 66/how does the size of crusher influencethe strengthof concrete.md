## How size of aggregate affect on strength of concrete?
The tensile strength of the concrete is severely affected by increasing the size of the aggregate. On increasing the maximum grain size to mm, the reduction in tensile strength is 30-50% as compared with concretes with maximum aggregate size 20 mm. There is also a reduction in the elongation limit

Retaining Walls. Layering crushed concrete is also a great way to create a retaining wall and control erosion on slopes or hills in your yard. Different sizes of crushed concrete can function together to help prevent erosion. A layer of smaller, more broken-up crushed concrete as a base will contribute to the stability of the wall.
