## About steel
Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon containing less than 2% carbon and 1% manganese and small amounts of silicon, phosphorus, sulphur and oxygen. Steel is the world's most important engineering and construction material. It is used in every aspect of our lives; in cars and construction products, refrigerators and washing machines, cargo

## Construction Equipment & Machinery Used in Construction Industry
A bulldozer is a powerful, extremely heavy machine employed to move dirt. Bulldozer considered as a strongest and most solid heavy machinery in the construction industry. Bulldozers have a wide, flat blade in front of the cabin is operated using two hydraulic pistons to move the blade in a limited range of angles and depths.

## What Types of Machines Are Used in Metal Fabrication?
Nov 25, 2021Drilling machine: As you can tell by the name, these metal fabrication machines are used to drill holes. Professionals can also use drilling machines on concrete, cement and pretty much any other hard surface. Magnetic drill: For drilling into pieces of heavy metal that can't be lifted easily, metalworkers often turn to a magnetic drill.

## How Machine Tools are Used in the Automotive Industry
MILLING MACHINES. Milling machines are used to cut and drill material, most commonly metal. Millers can cut metal to create holes, smooth out sides, or create indentations so pieces of metal fit together. In the auto industry, both vertical and horizontal milling machines are used to cut and shape the body pieces as well as other components.

## What Allowed Manufacturers To Build Their Factories Away From Rivers?
The steam engines were being used to run machines in factories instead of water power. Now factories could be built farther away from water sources. A steam engine could be built to be used anywhere.  As steel is stronger and lighter in weight than iron the use of a steel frame made possible the construction of truly tall buildings.

Machine Lubrication With Water-Based Fluids: Use Additives, Mixing and the Right Water. Many oil-based fluids have been replaced by vegetable oils and water-soluble cutting fluids. All coolants, however, contain additives that enhance lubricity, inhibit rust and (most) bacteria growth, or reduce foaming.

The iron ore is smelted out to form pig iron, the raw and purest form of iron. The pig iron is usually distributed in the form of ingots. Pig iron is then combined with other elements such as carbon, chromium, etc. to obtain materials like cast iron, steel, and alloy steel. Steel plants do the job of separating the pig iron from the iron ore.

Press Brakes. A press brake machine is used to give structural steel the desired shape and contours. Several dies are used in the process. Once this is done then the steel sections are sent for welding where different parts are assembled together.
