At present, all limestone aggregates to be used in Florida Department of Transportation ( FDOT ) projects fall under a single category and must meet the same set of minimum durability requirements. For example, a limestone aggregate mine which could not produce aggregates with a maximum LA Abrasion Loss of 45% would not be approved by FDOT.

## Crushed stone size chartify
This study is intended to inspect the impact of sizes of crushed stones of diameter of 14 mm, 19 mm and 28 mm on compressive and split tensile strength of concrete. Three separate mix designs were.  If your patio is 20 feet long and 10 feet wide, and you need 6 inches of crushed stone for the base, you would plug those numbers into the
