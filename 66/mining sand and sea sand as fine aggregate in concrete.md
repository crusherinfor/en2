Sea sand contains chloride ions beyond the acceptable limit causes sever durability issues. Therefore, much attention is required when offshore sand is used in construction. The chloride content in the concrete is limited to 0.4% by mass of cement generally. BS 5328 Part 1 1997 specify this limit and BS 882 1992 have bit higher values (0.5%).

## Can Sea Sand be Used for Concrete Construction?
Concrete is a mixture of cement, coarse aggregates, fine aggregates or sand and water. Among them, natural river sand is the main source of fine aggregate or sand. However, with the exhaustion of river sand resources and restricted mining, the contradiction between the supply and demand of construction sand has become more and more intense.

## Feasibility of Sea-Sand Sea-Water Concrete - IJERT
Fine aggregate. In this project sea sand and M-sand are used as fine aggregate .As per IS, T-4, the fine aggregate can be graded into 4 zones depending upon the %finer retained in each sieve. Graph is plotted with sieve opening to log scale on X-axis and %finer on Y-axis. The obtained curve is called Grading curve

## What is Fine Aggregate - Types and Uses
Fine aggregate is basically any normal sand particle that comes from the land through the mining process. Fine aggregates comprise regular sand or any squashed stone particles that are 1/4″ or smaller. This item is frequently alluded to as 1/4″ short as it alludes to the size, or evaluation, of this specific aggregate. Fine Aggregate.
