## What is Concrete Sand? - Reliable Contracting Co. Inc.
Concrete sand is a label that is typically used to describe the coarse washed sand that is a common ingredient in cement and asphalt mixtures. Its grains are larger than those of masonry sand, but a processing and screening process ensures that there are no large rocks or pebbles present. This material is often made of things like gneiss

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Aggregates are the major ingredients of concrete. Aggregates are derived from rocks. They are broadly divided into two categories i.e. fine aggregate and coarse aggregate. Their properties are depended on the mineralogical composition of the rock. Crushed rocks are used as coarse aggregates are river sand is used as fine aggregates.

The root cause of segregation of concrete is the difference in specific gravity and size of its constituent material. The specific gravity of water is 1.0. The specific gravity of cement is around 3.15 while that of aggregate is 2.6 to 2.7. Due to differences in specific gravity lighter particles have a tendency to move upwards and heavier

Besides usage in concrete, concrete sand can also be used in bedding pipes. This type of sand is usually crushed in a quarry and filtered severally to remove huge fragments and large rocks.
