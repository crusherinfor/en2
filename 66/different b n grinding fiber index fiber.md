## Portland cement
Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and non-specialty grout.It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the early 19th century by Joseph Aspdin, and is usually made from limestone.It is a fine powder, produced by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln to form clinker

Conclusion. Step-index fiber and graded-index fiber are two types of multimode fibers. Graded-index fiber offers superior transmission quality, higher-bandwidth, and longer distance. Higher modal dispersion limits the bandwidth of the step-index fiber. In modern communication applications, graded-index fiber is preferred.

They have a central core surrounded by a concentric cladding with slightly lower (by ≈ 1%) refractive index. Optical fibers are typically made of silica with index-modifying dopants such as GeO 2.
