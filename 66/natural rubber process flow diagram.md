Rubber is vulcanized to steel cords that are spirally wrapped to form bead wire. The bead is the part of the tire that attaches to the rim. It takes a lot of pressure to mount a tire on the wheel. Other key components of a tyre include the steel bead wires which hold the tyre on the rim of the wheel, the casing ply that gives the tyre strength

Depth and Understanding: Natural rubber is the oldest elastomeric material; its use predates even its "discovery" by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage to the New World. Since many compounders have been schooled in rubber chemistry while working with natural rubber formulas, there is usually a certain comfort level with natural rubber.

From the first commercial rubber plantation in Sri Lankan, the nation has had a proud history of manufacturing high quality natural rubber latex. Rubber was first introduced in the late 19th century under the British. Though slow to catch on, the cultivation of rubber accelerated in the early 1900's due to a slump in world tea prices.

## Natural Rubber: Cultivation and Processing of Natural Rubber
Rubber trees can be tapped for about 35 years. The collected latex is first coagulated into soft, spongy blocks by adding formic acid or acetic acid. This makes it solid and produces sheets which are cut into standard size. There are several other ways of processing the rubber. The latest processing method is to produce Hevea crumb.

Oct 15, 2020Latex is gathered from the trees by making a cut in the bark and collecting the runny sap in cups. This process is called tapping. In order to prevent the sap from solidifying, ammonia is added. Acid is then added to the mix to extract the rubber, in a process called coagulation. This can take about 12 hours.

However rubber articles can also be moulded using this technique. The polymer is preheated in a cylindrical chamber, a temperature at which it will flow and is then forced into a comparatively cold, closed mould cavity by means of high pressure. A great advantage of the process is the speed with which the articles can be produced in seconds.
