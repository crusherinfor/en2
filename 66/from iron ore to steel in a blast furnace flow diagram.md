## Iron Ore Processing Plant With 50 Years Experiences
The HIsarna steelmaking process is a process of primary steelmaking in which iron ore is processed almost directly into steel. The process is based on a new type of blast furnace called a Cyclone Converter Furnace, which makes it possible to skip the process of manufacturing pig iron pellets, a necessary step in the basic oxygen steelmaking

## Draw the diagram of the blast furnace used in the extraction of iron 
Complete step by step answer: First, let us know about the use of blast furnaces. As mentioned it is used to attain the iron by reduction with the carbon, and carbon is attained in the form of coke. The ores extracted in the blast furnace are hematite, magnetite. Now, we will draw the diagram of a blast furnace used in the extraction of iron.

Before iron ore can be used, oxygen must be removed from it. Known as 'reducing', this can be done either in the blast furnace, where hot air is injected into a continuous feed of coke, sinter and lime, or by the direct reduced iron (DRI) process. The result from both is liquid iron, which is then transported to the basic oxygen furnace. The blast furnace process also produces two

A blast furnace is a steel cylinder lined with refractory. It operates continuously until the lining wears out, which takes many years to occur. The term blast furnace comes from the blast of hot air that is blown into the lower part of the furnace at between 1400º to 2100ºF. Molten iron is produced in a blast furnace by the following steps: 1.

12.5 Iron And Steel Production. Iron is produced in blast furnaces by the reduction of iron bearing materials with a hot gas. The large, refractory lined furnace is charged through its top with iron as ore, pellets, and/or sinter; flux as limestone, dolomite, and sinter; and coke for fuel.

##  12.5 Iron And Steel Production - US EPA
The production of 1 ton of iron requires 1.4 tons of ore or other iron bearing material; 0.5 to 0.65 tons of coke; 0.25 tons of limestone or dolomite; and 1.8 to 2 tons of air. Byproducts consist of 0.2 to 0.4 tons of slag, and 2.5 to 3.5 tons of blast furnace gas containing up to 100 pounds (lb) of dust.
