## Carbon In Leach - Process and Optimization | SC Filtration
Feb 8, 2021For CIL, carbon must be added to crude/solvent tincture and agitated for 20-30 minutes. Carbon is added to the tincture in 3-4 portions to promote better adsorption. This is because carbon's affinity to certain particles changes as the carbon pores are used up. Adding fresh carbon in stages reduces the overall dosage necessary and ultimately

Photorespiration can drain away as much as 50% of the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle on a hot, dry day. Certain plant species have evolved alternate modes of carbon fixation to minimize photorespiration. C4 plants first fix CO2 in a four-carbon compound. Several thousand plants, including sugarcane and corn, use this pathway.

Activated carbon also consumes cyanide, so its effect has to be accounted for in the case of carbon-in-leach (CIL) or carbon-in-pulp (CIP) plant flowsheets. Since cyanide is an expensive reagent, often a major component of plant operating costs, it is important that the scale-up of cyanide consumption from laboratory to plant be representative.
