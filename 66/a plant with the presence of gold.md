## Phytomining: Can plants really grow gold? - Manhattan Gold & Silver
The method of using plants to extract particles of gold from soil is called phytomining. It works by taking a fast-growing plant with leafy mass, such as mustard, sunflowers or tobacco, and planting the crop on soil that contains gold. Once the plants grow to their maximum height, the soil is then treated with a chemical to make the gold soluble.
