## Cement
A cement is a binder, a substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together. Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel, produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is behind only water as

## The cement mill - Understanding Cement
Cement manufacturing -brief description of a cement mill. Cement clinker is usually ground using a ball mill. This is essentially a large rotating drum containing grinding media - normally steel balls. As the drum rotates, the motion of the balls crushes the clinker. The drum rotates approximately once every couple of seconds.

The ball mill is a traditional coal pulverizer machine, which has been widely used since it was invented. In the cement plant, the new dry process cement manufacturing requires the moisture content of coal powder to be 0.5% ~ 1.5%, while that of raw coal is 1.5% ~ 4.0%. Therefore, the ball mill should have a drying function besides grinding.
