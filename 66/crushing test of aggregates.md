This involves either testing aggregate larger than 14mm in the standard mould or for aggregates retained 2.36mm, the standard or modified smaller mould. 2.2 The aggregate to be tested must be in a surface dry condition.

Generally, the test is conducted on aggregate passing 12.5 mm and retained on a 10 mm sieve. Q. Why is the aggregate crushing value test done? Ans. The strength of coarse aggregates is determined by the aggregates crushing test. The aggregate crushing value test provides resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied

## Aggregate Crushing value test procedure | Civil4M
The aggregate crushing value is an indirect measure of crushing strength of the aggregates. Low aggregate crushing value indicates strong aggregates, as the crushed fraction is low. Thus the test can be used to assess the suitability of aggregates with reference to the crushing strength for various types of pavement components.

## Tests on Stones | Crushing Strength Test, Water Absorption Test 
This test is carried out on stones that are used as aggregates for road construction. The test result indicates the suitability of stones against the grinding action under traffic. Anyone of the following tests could be conducted to find out the suitability of aggregates: Los Angeles Abrasion Test; Deval Abrasion Test; Dorry's Abrasion Test.

## AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE (IS:2386-Part 4-1963)
Aggregate crushing Value =(W B /W A) × 100 Record. The mean of the two results is reported to the nearest whole number as the aggregate crushing value of the tested material. Safety & Precautions: Use hand gloves while removing containers from oven after switching off the oven. To wear safety shoes & helmet during the time of test.
