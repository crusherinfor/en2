## Water Wheel (Immersive Engineering) - Feed The Beast Wiki
Item. The Water Wheel is an item added by Immersive Engineering. It is used to generate Redstone Flux (RF) when connected to the front of a Kinetic Dynamo . The Water Wheel must be connected to a flowing water stream in order to work, and the amount of power produced scales directly with the number of flowing water blocks adjacent to the wheel.

## How To Make A Water Mill To Generate Electricity - Realonomics
Water mills harness kinetic energy from moving bodies of water (usually rivers or streams) in order to drive machinery and generate electricity. The movement of the water drives the water wheel which in turn powers a mechanical process within the mill itself. How do you make a water wheel generator? Can a water mill power a house?

## Homemade Water Wheel Electric Generator - PrepperFortress
This is exactly the same principle. Usually, for a water wheel electric generator you need at least 3 feet of fall and at least 20 gallons per minute of flow. The more fall and flow you have, the more potential power you can generate. You can measure flow by building a weir in the creek and measuring how fast it will fill up a 5 gallon bucket.
