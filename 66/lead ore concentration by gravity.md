## Lead
Lead is a chemical element with the symbol Pb (from the Latin plumbum) and atomic number 82. It is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials. Lead is soft and malleable, and also has a relatively low melting point.When freshly cut, lead is silvery with a hint of blue; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element

As main gangue minerals, calcite, dolomite, and some silicates are present in both ore types. Before 1960, the lead-vanadate-containing ore from different ore bodies was processed using gravity concentration. The processing plant for flotation of lead, zinc, and vanadate minerals was introduced by the end of 1961 and closed in 1978.
