## Methods to Separate Metal From Ore - Geology | ScienceBriefss
Sep 26, 2021Hydrometallurgy. Metallurgy consists of three general steps: (1) mining the ore, (2) separating and concentrating the metal or the metal-containing compound, and (3) reducing the ore to the metal. Additional processes are sometimes required to improve the mechanical properties of the metal or increase its purity.

## The process or act of extracting a metal from its ore.
Now for the right answer to the above question: Option A is incorrect. extraction does not include refining and modification. Option B is not correct. metal mining involves the mining of its ore from the earth, and not extracting the metal from this ore and refining. C is correct. metallurgy = extraction + refining.

## extraction of metal from ore
An ore is usually a compound of the metal mixed with impurities. When the metal is dug up, a method must be used to separate the metal from the rest of the ore. This is called extracting the metal. The method of extraction depends on how reactive the metal is. The more reactive the metal, the more difficult it is to extract from its compound.
