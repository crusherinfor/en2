The masher is a crusher consisting of moving jaws and static rafts. It is used to simulate the movement of animals and complete the crushing of materials.When the jaw crusher is working, the jaws wear first.As the material enters the crushing chamber, the moving jaws are squeezed to form a strongly compressed state, and the fixed jaws are subject to intense cutting by material friction

## Jaw Crusher Working Principle - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The jaw crusher discharge opening is the distance from the valley between corrugations on one jaw to the top of the mating corrugation on the other jaw. The crusher discharge opening governs the size of finished material produced by the crusher. Measuring Discharge Opening: Measure distance at bottom of jaws at the point of the crushing cycle when the bottom of jaws is closest together.

## Improving jaw crusher safety | Hub-4
Crushing is an important process in turning rock into a useable product. Rock enters the jaw crusher from the top of the machine and gets compressed between two surfaces â the fixed and moveable jaw. The rock will continue to be crushed until it is small enough to fall through the opening. Ensuring that the size of raw material is
