Any copper(I) oxide present will be converted into copper(I) sulfide during the smelting process because copper has a higher affinity for sulfur than it does for oxygen. for example: Cu 2 O + FeS → Cu 2 S + FeO. Impurities form a slag which floats on the surface and is easily removed. One of the reactions to remove iron impurities is shown below:

Melting the Copper. Copper melts at 1981.4 degrees Fahrenheit or 1083 degrees Celsius. The question of how to melt copper is a straightforward one. You will need a furnace capable of heating the metal to higher than that temperature, and sustaining the heat. Load your scrap copper into the crucible (furnace) and turn on the furnace.

## Copper extraction
Copper sulfide and iron oxide can mix, but when sufficient silica is added, a separate slag layer is formed. Adding silica also reduces the melting point (or, more properly, the liquidus temperature) of the slag, meaning that the smelting process can be operated at a lower temperature. The slag forming reaction is: FeO + SiO 2 → FeO.SiO 2

## Smelting
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore, to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

## By products of copper ore smelting?s
What is produced by copper smelting? The traditional process is based on roasting, smelting in reverbatory fur- naces (or electric furnaces for more complex ores), producing matte (copper-iron sulfide), and con- verting for production of blister copper, which is further refined to cathode copper.

## Copper - Sulphuric Acid
In most copper smelters the primary smelting process produces a low to medium grade matte. The converter carries out the bulk of the oxidation where between 30 to 80% of the sulphur originally in the concentrate is eliminated. Traditionally, converting is a two-cycle batch process which has several disadvantages:

## How Copper Smelting Pollutes? | IAS Abhiyan
About Copper Smelting: Copper, while an essential nutrient, is toxic to animals and humans in high concentrations. The main pollutants are released by the process of smelting. Most copper ores are sulphur-based and smelting releases sulphur dioxide, an air pollutant known to have many harmful effects.

## Extraction Of Copper | Mining, Concentration, Smelting - Byju's
Copper Smelting: Smelting is a metallurgy technique to extract base metals from their ores with the help of heat and a chemical reducing agent. (Click here for extraction process). Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace. The major steps in
