## Machining Processes: Turning, Milling, and Drilling - Trimantec
We cover three of the most common operations including turning, drilling, and milling. Machining is a very common and versatile manufacturing process. Thus, it's possible to machine various types of material using these three methods. Metals, plastics, composites, and wood are all possible workpiece materials.

The column-and-knee milling machines are the basic machine tool for milling. The name comes from the fact that this machine has two principal components, a column that supports the spindle, and a knee that supports the work table. There are two different types of column-and-knee milling machines according to position of the spindle axis

Milling is the machining process in which the removal of metal takes place due to the cutting action of a rotating milling cutter.In a milling machine, the cutter is rotating due to workpiece is fed against it.This machine can hold more than one tool at a time. The cutter rotates at high speed, and because of the many cutting edges, it removes metal at a very fast rate.
