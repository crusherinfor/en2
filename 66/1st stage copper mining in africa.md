## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels, called adits, to reach the ore. Underground mining is, however, relatively expensive and is generally limited to rich ores. El Teniente, in Chile, is the world's largest
