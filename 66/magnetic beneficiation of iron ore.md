## 5 Aspects of Magnetic Separator to Improve Manganese Beneficiation 
Magnetic separation is one of the main beneficiation methods for manganese beneficiation, and magnetic separator is the main equipment in this stage. In actual production, the operation of the magnetic separator has a very obvious influence on the separation index of manganese ore.

Jun 28, 2022The iron minerals in the ore are magnetite and hematite or siderite, mostly fine grains; the gangue minerals are mainly quartz, and some contain more iron silicate. The proportion of magnetite in the ore varies, often increasing gradually from the surface of the deposit to the depths. There are two commonly used beneficiation methods for such ores:

There are many mineral processing methods, and there are two commonly used methods (1). Roasting magnetic separation Roasting magnetic separation is one of the effective methods to separate fine to fine (< 0.02mm) weakly magnetic iron ore. When the minerals in ore are complex and it is difficult to get good indexes by other methods, magnetization roasting magnetic separation should be used.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ore - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Beneficiation of Iron Ore and the treatment of magnetic iron taconites, stage grinding and wet magnetic separation is standard practice.This also applies to iron ores of the non-magnetic type which after a reducing roast are amenable to magnetic separation. All such plants are large tonnage operations treating up to 50,000 tons per day and ultimately requiring grinding as fine as minus 500
