Check your driveway a second time just after a good rain, and look for any areas of standing water. Caulk and seal any cracks that you find in your driveway, and seal any damaged expansion joints. Use a concrete re-surfacer to level out any low spots, or to put a "new face" on damaged concrete. Lift up any areas that have begun to sink.

F.M of Ideal fine aggregate for concrete applications are in range of 2.6 to 2.9. Fine sand (lower F.M Value ) reduces the sand requirement % in the total aggregate proportion. On the other hand, coarser sand will require higher sand % in the total aggregate proportion to give a cohesive concrete mix consuming least cement.
