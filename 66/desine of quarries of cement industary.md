## Manufacturing process
Step 1: Mining. The cement manufacturing process starts from the mining of raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing, mainly limestone and clays. A limestone quarry is inside the plant area and a clays quarry is as far from the plant area as 25 km. The limestone is excavated from open cast mines after drilling and blasting and loaded

## Limestone quarry, quarrying, cement raw materials
Cement manufacturing begins with quarrying operations in which limestone in mines is quarried and brought to crusher for crushing. Limestone quarries are opencast mines. Often limestone appears as an outcrop right on the surface. At other times it is under an overburden that can vary in depth but is generally less than 3 metres thick.

Concrete countertops, sinks, fire features and furniture require vastly higher quality concrete than sidewalks or even foundations, in terms of both performance and aesthetics. One of the keys to the best concrete countertop mix design is to keep the water cement ratio very low. Typically concrete countertop artisans use w/c ratios of about 0.32%.

A quarry is essentially a type of mine that is used to extract stones and such that will be repurposed into building materials. Quarries belong to a group of mines called open pit mines. The reasoning for this name resides in the fact that these mines are open to Earth's surface. Quarries in Connecticut are no different than your average quarry.
