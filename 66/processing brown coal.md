## Brown Coal - Climate Hero
Brown coal is a typ of coal that is also known as lignite.  These categories depend on the decomposition process of the coal, which basically means how long the coal has been underground. For example, about a 65-84 % content of carbon counts as lignite or peat. While between 84-91 % is categorised as hard coal.

Coal is a black or brownish-black sedimentary rock that can be consumed and used to generate electricity. It is composed mostly of carbon and hydrocarbons, which contain energy that can be released through combustion. Coal is produced by tectonic motion. The dead biotic material will have changed after a few geological processes.
