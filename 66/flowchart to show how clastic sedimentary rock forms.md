Sedimentary rocks form from particles deposited by water and wind. true. What are the three forces that can carry sediment? running water, wind or ice. Dissolved minerals glue sediments together. cementation. Sediments are pressed together in layers. compaction. Water or wind loosen and carry away fragments of rock.

Edgecomb Gray is one of THE MOST NEUTRAL taupe paint colours with minimal undertones. Many greiges will pick up a green undertone, whereas taupes tend to favour purple or pink. Edgecomb Gray favours a very (very) mild pink undertone. The less committed a colour is to an undertone, the more likely it is to grab another.

Sedimentary rocks are classified based on how they form and on the size of the sediments if they are clastic. Clastic sedimentary rocks are formed from rock fragments or clasts chemical sedimentary rocks precipitate from fluids and biochemical sedimentary rocks form as precipitation from living organisms.

## Sedimentary the following categories. Siliciclastic rocks or clastic 
Sedimentary rocks are from sediments collected from the streams and buried beneath in a process commonly referred to as geologic. This is due to geographical effects such as the tectonic forces controlling the progression of weathering. The process leaves a complicated record thus the different kind of sediments form the deposits. (Strahler, 13) The categories.Read More

## Clastic Sedimentary Rocks - CliffsNotes
The finer‐grained clastic sedimentary rocks are called shale, siltstone, and mudstone. Shale is a smooth, thinly layered rock that is made up of fine‐grained silt and clay particles. Shale is considered a fissile rock because it splits very naturally along its layers. A siltstone contains mostly silt grains and looks very similar to shale

This sediment is often formed when weathering and erosion break down a rock into loose material in a source area. How is sedimentary rocks are formed? Clastic sedimentary rocks are made up of pieces (clasts) of pre-existing rocks. Pieces of rock are loosened by weathering then transported to some basin or depression where sediment is trapped.

## how a sedimentary rock is formed flowchart
2.5 Sedimentary Rocks. Sedimentary rocks can form in several ways (Figure 2.13) and are classified as clastic, chemical, and organic based on how they form. The most common way sedimentary rocks form is when other rocks weather into small particles and are transported by wind, water, or ice to an area where they are deposited and form layers.

Rock Flow Chart by Dean Nguyen on Prezi. Sedimentary rocks begin when wind or rain break off pieces of rock and then the rocks are then transported to the bottom of mountains or the bottom of oceans. The deposited rock then sits there for over thousands and thousands of years. Each deposited rock is in its own layer.
