4 P + 5 O2 → 2 P2O5. Roasting is the process of heating iron ore strongly in dry air for drying the ore and expelling humidity, It is used to increase the percentage of iron in the ore and for the oxidation of some impurities such as sulphur and phosphorus. Roasting of iron is very important in the ore dressing process but this process

## Roasting (metallurgy)
Roasting is a process of heating a sulfide ore to a high temperature in the presence of air. It is a step in the processing of certain ores.More specifically, roasting is often a metallurgical process involving gas-solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s). Often before roasting, the ore has already been partially purified, e.g. by froth

Many types of furnace are used for reduction smelting. The blast furnace is universally used in the reduction of such compounds as iron oxide, zinc oxide, and lead oxide, though there are great differences between the furnace designs used in each case. Iron, found naturally in the oxide ores hematite and magnetite, is smelted in a tall, circular, sealed blast furnace (see figure).

In some places reduction roasting of the low grade hematite ore is done to convert it into magnetic ore before the application of the magnetic separation method for the ore beneficiation. Another method which can be employed is the use of a dense medium in a gas-solid fluidized bed for the enrichment of iron ore.

## Autogenous roasting of iron ore - CAVANAGH; PATRICK E.
When iron ores are roasted at temperatures above about 1500° F., the magnetite mineral contained in the ore oxidizes rapidly enough to act as a significant source of heat for the process. The fuel value of magnetite burned in this way is about 7000 BTU/lb. When magnetite is burned, hematite is produced.

Iron ore concentrate is converted to magnetic gamma hematite in an autogenous roasting operation which is self-sustaining. The iron ore concentrate is preheated and contained magnetite is oxidized to hematite. Hematite is reduced to magnetite using carbon monoxide. After cooling, the magnetite is oxidatively exothermically converted to magnetic gamma hematite.
