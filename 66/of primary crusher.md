## Primary and secondary crushers - Welding Alloys
Where the material is not reduced sufficiently in the primary crusher, it is then crushed by a secondary crusher to achieve the correct size of the material. Wear on parts of the crushers affect the performance and volume of material being crushed, the parts subject to high impact, and abrasive wear include the hammers, rotors, teeth, and mantles.

## The History of Jaw Crushers and Cone Crushers
The first cone crusher was developed by the Symons brothers to improve secondary and tertiary crushing applications. While jaw crushers provide excellent primary crushing duties, new ways of crushing needed to be devised for finer and more consistently sized aggregates. In 1920, the Symons brothers created the first cone crusher.
