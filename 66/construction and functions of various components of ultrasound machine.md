Construction And Functions Of Various Components Of . The Ultrasound Machine How Ultrasound Works . A basic ultrasound machine has the following parts: Transducer probes come in many shapes and sizes, as shown in the photo above. The shape of the probe determines its field of view, and the frequency of emitted sound waves determines how .

## DC Machine: Basic Components and Function | EE Power School
There are two main parts, the stator and the rotor. The stator contains parts such as brushes, magnets and housing for the whole motor. The rotor contains the windings, the communicator and the output shaft. The two parts work together when voltage is applied to create a moving motor. A DC Machine. DC motors work in two directions.

The components and construction of these different types of transducers are principally the same. To understand how modern day electronic multi-element transducers function we need to start by considering the construction and components of a simple single element circular transducer. This is illustrated in Figure 6.2.

## Ultrasound (Sonography)
Ultrasound machines consist of a computer console, video monitor and an attached transducer. The transducer is a small hand-held device that resembles a microphone. Some exams may use different transducers (with different capabilities) during a single exam. The transducer sends out inaudible, high-frequency sound waves into the body and listens

This is the most common advanced imaging technology and is found on about 90% of available new and refurbished ultrasound machines. What is it? Harmonics imaging allows the ultrasound to identify body tissue and reduce artifact in the image. It does this by sending and receiving signals at two different ultrasound frequencies.

1) Resistor. Resistor with symbol. A resistor is an electrical component that regulates or restricts the flow of an electrical current in a circuit. This can also be used to provide a specific voltage to a transistor. When current flows through the resistor, the electrical energy is absorbed by the resistor and dissipated in the form of heat.
