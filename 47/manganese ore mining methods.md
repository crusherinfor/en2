At present, the commonly used manganese ore beneficiation methods mainly include mechanical beneficiation (ore washing, screening, gravity separation, strong magnetic separation and flotation) and special beneficiation (fire enrichment and chemical beneficiation).  Therefore, in the case of open-pit mining or more slime, the slime must be
