## Cone Crusher | Working Principle | Animation | Engineering Intro
Cone crusher has a less steep crushing chamber and more parallel zone between crushing zones. It breaks the rocks by squeezing it between the gyrating spindles. These spindles are fully covered with resistant mantle and a manganese bowl liner covers the hopper. Rocks get squeezed at the same moment when it enters in between the bowl liner and

## A Detailed Overview of Cone Crushers and What You Need to Know
Cone crushers are compression machines that take in raw materials and reduce them in size by crushing them. A variety of industries rely on these tools, such as the concrete, aggregate, mining, coal, and natural gas industries. Inside the crusher, a piece of steel, known as the mantle, rotates eccentrically.

These two-piece fittings screw directly onto the hose without the need for a separate adapter. When assembled, the fitting compresses against the hose, forming a strong seal. Also known as reusable fittings, they can be unscrewed from the hose end and used on a new hose. Use in high-pressure hydraulic applications up to 5, 800 psi.
