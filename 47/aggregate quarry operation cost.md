According to the US Geological Survey, the US consumed almost 7 metric tonnes of aggregate per person in 2010. In the US market, the majority (80% or more) of aggregates are transported by truck from the quarry to the consumer. This form of transport is expensive and limits the typical aggregate operation to a market radius of about 80 kilometres.
