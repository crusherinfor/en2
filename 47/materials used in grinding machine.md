## Abrasive materials for industrial valve grinding | LarsLap®
Grit abrasive is manufactured by attaching grit up to a certain size in an irregular pattern onto the backing. This results in very effective abrasion but a less smooth finish compared to micron abrasives. The grit is made from aluminium oxide and ceramic materials. LarsLap mainly uses 40, 80, 120 and 180 grit.
