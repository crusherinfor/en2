## Properties of Green Concrete Containing Quarry Rock Dust and Marble 
Through reaction with the concrete admixture, Marble sludge powder and quarry rock dust improved pozzolanic reaction, micro-aggregate filling, and concrete durability. This paper presents the feasibility of the usage of quarry rock dust and marble sludge powder as hundred percent substitutes for natural sand in concrete.

Waste marble powder can be used either as filler or as fine aggregate in concrete and helps to reduce the total void content in concrete. In concrete waste marble powder can be used as an admixture, so that the strength can be altered. In this project, the marble sludge powder used as filler material and collected at sivakasi.

## Sustainability | Free Full-Text | Utilization of Fly Ash as a Viscosity 
Sufficient deformability can be achieved in concrete while maintaining segregation resistance either by using a chemical viscosity-modifying admixture (VMA) or increasing the fine content in the concrete. Using VMA, the initial cost of self-compacting concrete (SCC) increases, making it unsuitable for general construction. As a result, alternative methods for lowering the cost of SCC must be
