Testing Phase. The testing phase is essential to the soil compaction procedure. It involves continuously measuring the density of the soil to monitor the fluctuations as the air is driven out. Testing strips are a basic and a sure-fire way to determine the best method of compaction. Every layer of sound may have different percentages of density

## How is soil compaction with crushed stone?
Crushed stone is poured and the compaction process is started with the help of rollers. The average depth of compaction is 0.5 m. There are heavy types of tamping, in which the soil is compacted by 1.5-2.5 m. The amount of crushed stone is calculated in tons.
