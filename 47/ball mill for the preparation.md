## Ball Mills Preparation
A ball mill rotates its long shaft, and drivear which is placed on it. the friction of the rubber surface of the shaft can rotate the jar. the grinding beads grinding balls in the jar will constantly hit the sample due to gravity and mechanical force. afterong period of rotation and impact, the sample gradually changes from large pieces to small pieces, and small pieces.
