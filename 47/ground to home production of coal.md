## Coal Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Coal production continues to grow globally due to the demand for low cost energy and iron and steel, as well as cement. Coal, based on the current extraction rates, will last about 115 years longer than conventional oil and gas reserves, with an estimated 1.1 trillion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide. Ten countries are responsible for 90% of the total global coal production.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.

The conversion of coal begins in pulverized coal combustion systems, which start the process by steaming coal, which then turns into powder. In its powder form, coal is added to boiler combustion chambers, which heat the substance to high temperatures. This reaction produces hot gases and heat energy, which combine with water to form steam.
