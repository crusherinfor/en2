## What Does Silver Look Like In Rocks - Realonomics
How do you tell if a rock has silver in it? Bright white quartz with streaks of gray are a good indicator of the presence of silver ore. Inspect each rock carefully since some silver deposits will be barely visible. Some silver runs through its host rock as "spider veins" that streak the interior of the rock and terminate just at the surface.

## Which rocks contain metallic flakes resembling silver and gold?
Re: Which rocks contain metallic flakes resembling silver and gold? « Reply #1 on: 29/07/2017 18:38:42 ». The most likely candidate for the silver and gold flakes are iron sulphides - also known as iron pyrites or, "fools gold". Lead sulphide (galena) also produces silvery inclusions that would fit the bill with what you describe.

Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander. Because gold is heavy, it will sink to the bottom of the mining pan even while it's submerged in water, while the other minerals wash away. Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.
