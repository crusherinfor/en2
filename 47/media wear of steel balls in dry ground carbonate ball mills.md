## Wear of mill components during the ball milling of calcium carbonate 
Rates of wear in 1-liter capacity ball mills of either enstatite porcelain (MgSiO 3) or stainless steel have been studied during prolonged grinding for 1000 hr. The brittle enstatite balls wore at a rate ∼250 times faster than those of the ductile steel.

Hebbar (2011) concluded among other that the austempered ductile iron balls offered better wear resistance than the forged EN 31 steel balls, and that the wear loss of the media was lower in the slurry with higher pH values. Raghavendra et al. (2010) have reported similar findings with austempered ductile iron balls compared to EN 31 steel

A ball mill is a form of grinder that is used to blend or grind materials for use. It is a cylindrical device mainly for grinding material such as iron ores, ceramic raw materials, glass, steel, etc. The ball mill works on impact and attrition principle. Its impact is the size reduction given that the balls drop from almost the top of the shell

## What is Dry process calcium carbonate ball mill
The grinding feed particle size of the calcium carbonate Ball Mill is generally not more than 25 mm, and the discharge particle size is between 0.074-0.89 mm, that is, 80-200 mesh. However, the grinding fineness of the Ball Mill is also related to the proportion of steel balls in the grinding medium. If the proportion of small and medium steel
