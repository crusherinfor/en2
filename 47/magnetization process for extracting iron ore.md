## Extraction of Iron: Meaning, Purification, & Extraction Methods
The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

## Extraction of Iron, Iron Mining, Iron Ore Processing - Xinhai Mining
The single gravity separation process is used to deal with the extraction of iron ore with coarser grain size, and the equipment is selected according to the grain size of the ore.  The combined iron ore processing technology only used for limonite, includes magnetization - magnetic separation process, flotation - strong magnetic separation
