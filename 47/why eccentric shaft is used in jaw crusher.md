## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Figure 8.1 shows two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. In the single toggle jaw crusher, an eccentric shaft is installed on the top of the crusher. Shaft rotation causes, along with the toggle plate, a compressive action of the moving jaw. A double toggle crusher has, basically, two shafts and two toggle plates.

## Characteristics and Comparison of Four Types of Jaw Crushers
The eccentric shaft and all jaw crushers of any style have some sort of eccentric motion. As the eccentric rotates it pushed down on the pitman which in turn flattens the angle between the two toggles since the rear toggle is pivoting against the frame, the front toggle pushes on the swing jaw closing the gap between the two jaw plates.

There are two main types of jaw crushers: double toggle and overhead eccentric jaw crusher. The only difference between these two crushers is the location of the pivot joint. In the overhead eccentric jaw crushers, the pivot joint is located at the bottom of the chamber, while at the double toggle crushers, the pivot joint is on the top.

3. Check the strength of the shaft. When check the strength of the shaft, you can only check the strength of the biggest moment, and that is the movable jaw plate's bearing. If it is smaller than the stress of the eccentric shaft, then the strength of the jaw crusher's eccentric shaft can meet the requirement, and Not vice versa.
