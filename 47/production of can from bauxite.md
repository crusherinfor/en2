In 1991, these facilities produced 4.5 million tons of primary aluminum. 12.1.2 Process Description 2-3 Primary aluminum production begins with the mining of bauxite ore, a hydrated oxide of aluminum consisting of 30 to 56 percent alumina (A l2O3) and lesser amounts of iron, silicon, and titanium. The ore is. Aluminum-production.

## India's mining industry urges government to remove fetters on bauxite
India's mining industry has urged the government to re-examine an export duty of 15% imposed on bauxite that has sharply cut down shipments as well as policy measures to facilitate production of the aluminium-making material.

## Can bauxite residue be used in the production of cement?
The cement sector can offer both industrially mature and industrially promising uses for bauxite residue, BR. Even if the cement sector is not panacea and most probably case specific. conditions will eventually determine a multitude of valorisation paths per refinery, it does offer a tangible paradigm. Some main points are summarised as follows:

Bauxite is an impure raw material. At least 6 tons of bauxite is required to produce 1 ton of aluminium. So it is advisable to set up alumina production plants near the bauxite mines. At present bauxite, rather aluminium, enjoys an enviable position, as it has outpaced several traditional metals like copper, tin etc.

Bauxite is collected from the ground in an open-pit mining operation. It doesn't sit very deeply in the earth's crust, so some energy can be saved on drilling. However, to recover all the aluminum in an area, swaths of land must be bull-dozed to reveal the dirt and ore underneath. Once collected, the bauxite ore has to be refined

Global bauxite production . Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, global bauxite production was estimated to have grown in 2020. Growth was mainly supported by higher output from Guinea, which is the world's second-largest bauxite producer, after Australia in 2020. Guinea's output was estimated to have increased in 2020.
