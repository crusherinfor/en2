## Which one of the following is not a method of concentration of ore?
In smelting the concentrated ores are heated and reduced by using some reducing agent to decompose the ore and driving off other elements as gases and slag, leaving behind the metal only. c. Gravity separation is also a method to concentrate ores which is based on the difference in the specific gravity of the various impurities present in the ore.

RUDN researchers have created and tested a method for processing titanium dental implants. It turned out that theanoslos of graphene on the surface of titanium improve its interaction with stem cells,which are placed on the implant so that it better "takes root".Thanks to this method ofprocessing, stem cells are better kept on the surface, multiply and turn into the desired cells.

Heavy media separation is a gravity separation process that crush ores into a certain size, and make the density of the fluid heavier than water (that is heavy medium). According to the Archimedes' principle of buoyancy, when density is less than media, ore particles will float; when the density is greater than media, ore particles will sink.

## Gravity separation
Gravity separation is an industrial method of separating two components, either a suspension, or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical: i.e. the components of the mixture have different specific weight. All of the gravitational methods are common in the sense that they all use gravity as the dominant force.

The correct answer is option 3. The gravity separation process is used for the concentration of haematite. Gravity Separation: This method of concentration of the ore is based on the difference in specific gravities of the metallic ore and gangue particles.

## Gravity Concentration - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Gravity concentration is the separation of minerals based upon the difference in density. Techniques of gravity concentration have been around for millennia. Some believe that the legend of the Golden Fleece from Homer's Odyssey was based upon a method of gold recovery, which was to place an animal hide (such as a sheep's fleece) in a
