Potential dangers of mining rare earth metals. Rare earth metals are used in wind turbines, also, which means that even though clean energy is generated, the use of these toxic metals makes the green energy impure. Rare earth metals mining generate a lot of radioactive waste which is dangerous for both humans and the environment.

Jan 1, 2022Rare Earth Metal Mining. You must successfully locate REMs in order to determine its viability as a source worth mining. Unlike other metals often found in ore deposits and veins that can be economically mined, earth elements are typically found in alkaline and igneous rocks and are not detected via metal detectors.REMs like Europium, Terbium, and Yttrium can be found at the bottom of the ocean.
