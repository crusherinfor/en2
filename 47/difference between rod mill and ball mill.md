The finesse of the material milled by the ball mill is 0.074mm-0.4mm, only except for the two small ball mills that have a wider range of 0.075-0.89mm. However, the rod mill fine grinding fineness is about 0.833-0.147mm. In terms of the fineness of the ground material, the ball mill has a finer handling ability.
