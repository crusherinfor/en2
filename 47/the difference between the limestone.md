## What Can Limestone Deposits Tell Scientists About The Environment In 
How did limestone originate? Limestone is formed in two ways. It can be formed with the help of living organisms and by evaporation. Ocean-dwelling organisms such as oysters clams mussels and coral use calcium carbonate (CaCO3) found in seawater to create their shells and bones. . The water pressure compacts the sediment creating limestone.

## The Difference Between Marble and Limestone - Natural Stone Designs
The Difference Between Marble and Limestone. When mud, sand, and shells are deposited in oceans and lakes, limestone is formed. Limestone is a type of rock that exists everywhere in the world. Marble, on the other hand, is a type of rock that is formed by the recrystallization of limestone during the mountain-building process.
