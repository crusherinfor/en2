## Gold revolution: developing Papua New Guinea's alluvial mining industry 
Developing alluvial mining in Papua New Guinea can greatly boost the rural economies, according to Immaculate Javia, founder of Sustainable Alluvial Mining Services. Her project won the inaugural Innovation PNG 2019 Award, Small Organisation Category, and it could revolutionise the small scale mining industry. David James reports.

In this stage, the ore are scrubbed to remove loose excess material and is screened. Material smaller than 1.5mm is discarded because it is too costly to extract diamonds from such a small piece of ore.

## Alluvial Diamond Mining Facts
Formal alluvial mining requires a considerable amount of material (called the 'over-burden') to be removed first to get to the gravel bed underneath, where diamonds are found. When diamonds are found on the ocean shore or on riverbeds, the gravel is removed and then taken to a plant where it is washed and screened for diamonds.

Alluvial mining in the area started in the early 19 th century. Renewed interest in the mining of alluvial diamonds was generated by the El Niño related drought of 1974 when many farmers turned to diamond mining. Much larger volumes of gravel could be moved and greater depths of gravel were reached owing to modern earth moving and sorting

## Mining industry of Guinea
The mining industry of Guinea was developed during colonial rule.The minerals extracted consisted of iron, gold, diamond, and bauxite. Guinea ranks first in the world in bauxite reserves and 6th in the extraction of high-grade bauxite, the aluminium ore. The mining industry and exports of mining products accounted for 17% of Guinea's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010.

## Alluvial diamond miners hampered by lack of support
The lack of bank financing for alluvial diamond mining makes it very difficult for black entrepreneurs to buy into an existing company. "One of the reasons that financiers shy away from alluvial diamond mining is that it is a very high-risk business," Lyndon says. "Grades are extremely low, at about 0.3 carats per hundred tonnes.

Alluvial diamonds can be found using a shovel, sieve, and pan, but extraction ultimately also involves the moving of large amounts of rock. Gravels hold the diamonds and running water is put to use. Diamonds are concentrated in sluices when the water levels of the streams are high.

The 3 standard types of diamond mining include open-pit mining, hard-rock mining and alluvial mining. There's also marine diamond mining which is extremely damaging since eco-systems that haven't even been fully understood are being destroyed. Each year, over 150 million carats of diamonds are extracted from the Earth through mining.
