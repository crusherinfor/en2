Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Open-pit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.
