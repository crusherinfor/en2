## Power plant engineering
Coal power plants operate in a manner similar to nuclear power plants in that the heat from the burning coal powers a steam turbine and electric generator.  Power station design consists of the design of new power plant systems. There are many types of power plants, and each type requires specific expertise, as well as interdisciplinary

## Thermal Power Plant General Layout - GradesFixer
A Thermal Power Plant converts the heat energy of coal into electrical energy. Coal is burnt in a boiler which converts water into steam. The expansion of steam in turbine produces mechanical power which drives the alternator (generator) coupled to the turbine. Thermal Power Plants contribute maximum to the generation of Power for any country.

## Coal-Fired Power Station - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Y. Yan, in Advanced Power Plant Materials, Design and Technology, 2010 10.1 Introduction. Coal-fired power stations are burning an increasingly varied range of fuels and fuel blends, including sub-bituminous and lower volatile coals and biomass of varying composition and combustion properties, under tight economic and environmental constraints. Since existing coal-fired plants are not designed

## Analysis of Coal-Fired Power Unit Operation in Reduced Minimum Safe 
Large coal-fired power plants were typically designed as a base load units. Any changes in load level, as well as start-up time, are noticeably slow on that kind of units.  To determine the technical-operational parameters of the power unit in off-design conditions the following indices were determined based on the results of simulation

## Conventional Coal-Fired Power Plant - an overview - ScienceDirect
Most existing coal-fired power plants use air as oxidant. The flue gas therefore contains CO 2 diluted in N 2. For the existing plants to be retrofitted to enable CO 2 recovery as a concentrated CO 2 stream for CCS there are mainly two options: 1. Oxy-fuel technology can be integrated with conventional coal-fired power plants and CFBC units.

The common number is 360 which means three extractors and eight coal generators. NOW the pipes can only carry 300 so you won't be able to use just one pipe. You'll have to do three and have one of the pipes split to the other two and add pumps for directional flow. This will give you 180 flow per pipe meaning it will supply 4 generators.
