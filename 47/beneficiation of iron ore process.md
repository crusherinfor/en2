## Iron Ore Beneficiation Process
Xinhai increased anionic reverse flotation process of magnetic concentrate on the basis of the single magnetic separation process. Iron ore concentrate was obtained directly with a roughing, tailings were discarded with three scavenging, middlings returned to efficient thickener. Finally, iron concentrate was increased from 64.25% to 67.22%.
