## South Africa Iron Ore Production To Trail Off In Coming Years As 
South Africa's iron ore production will see 5.0% y-o-y growth in 2021, as mines recover from Covid related production constraints. Expected iron ore production growth in the medium-term will be attributed to new projects coming online in a period where most projects emerging from West Africa have been delayed or cancelled. We expect iron ore production and growth to begin to trail off in

Between 1880 and 1920, southern West Virginia's population grew from 93,000 to 446,000, due almost entirely to the coal industry. The region's first coal miners primarily were African Americans, both enslaved and free. By 1850, approximately half of Kanawha County's slaves worked in the salt industry—many mined coal to fuel the furnaces.
