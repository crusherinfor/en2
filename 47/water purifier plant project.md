## How Is Water Purified in a Water Treatment Plant?
Coagulation. When water enters a treatment plant, the first stage in the process is coagulation where chemicals are added to the water supply to enable microparticles and small solids to stick together. Polyelectrolyte, ferrous sulfate, and aluminum sulfate are examples of chemicals used in the water treatment plant process to aid coagulation.
