## Top Industrial Belt Conveyor Issues (With Causes and Prevention)
Conveyor Belt Mistracking. Tracking, or training, refers to the way in which the belt rides on the rollers.  Material spilling off of the conveyor is also a commonly encountered problem in industrial belt conveyors. While spillage can occur at any point along the conveyor path, not surprisingly, it is most common at load and transfer points

## How to track a conveyor belt? | Mafdel
A conveyor belt allows for continuous movement of merchandise on a horizontal, inclined or declined conveyor. The upper surface of the conveyor belt is in direct contact with the transported product, and the lower surface is in contact with the conveyors mechanical components. Conveyor belts are used in many food or standard industries.

Belt Tracking Alignment Steps: 1. Check if the belt is in the centre.

## Excessive troughing causes conveyor belt damage - Martin Eng
If the belt's troughability is exceeded, the belt may not form the trough correctly, creating sealing and tracking problems. If a belt is too stiff and will not properly trough, it will not steer (track) properly through the system. This will quickly evolve into spillage off the sides of the conveyor and damage to the edges of the belt.

## Conveyor Belt Tracking Rules -- Nar Automation Engineering
Conveyor Belt Tracking Rules. A crowned or tapered pulley can aid in belt tracking. Normally, a belt moves toward the edge of the roller it meets first. If a belt is on a crowned pulley, it will travel towards the center. The belt tension will be higher in the central area, no matter which side of the roller pulley it tracks to since the belt
