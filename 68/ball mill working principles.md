5. The ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal,pigments,and fedspar for pottery. Grinding can be carried out in either wet or dry but the former is carried out at low speeds. The advantages of wet grinding are less power consumption,increased capacity,no dust formation etc.. Dis advantages are high wear on the grinding medium

Aug 6, 2021The design and manufacture of sand mills in my country originated in the 1960s, and now most of the market is horizontal sand mills. The sand mill in the world originated from the ball mill. The sand mill is an improved version of the ball mill. The material to be ground is finer and the particle size distribution is more uniform.
