This is usually achieved by a low intensity magnet suspended above, or at the head of, a conveyor. Separation of magnetic minerals from less magnetic minerals.

## Magnetic separation
Magnetic separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using a magnet to attract magnetic substances. The process that is used for magnetic separation separates non-magnetic substances from those which are magnetic. This technique is useful for the select few minerals which are ferromagnetic (iron-, nickel-, and cobalt-containing minerals) and paramagnetic.
