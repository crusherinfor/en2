Benefits. High Strength: When the belt operating tension has to be higher than 2500 KN/m, belts reinforced with steel cord are the only alternative; and there are steel cord belts designed for ratings up to 10000 KN/m. Steel cord belts are also an economic alternative to fabric belts with ratings between 1000 KN/m and 2500 KN/m.
