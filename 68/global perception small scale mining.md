## Large-scale and small-scale mining: what's the difference?
Sep 13, 2021The most common commodity mined via small-scale methods is gold while all other metals and non-metals are mined via large-scale means. Citing Philippine example, large-scale mining operations occupy an area of about 5 square kilometers (sqkm) covering the actual extraction site. The entire mine complex (i.e., admin buildings, processing plants

## Global Trends in Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM): A. - Delve
ASM has experienced explosive growth in recent years due to the rising value of mineral prices and the increasing difficulty of earning a living from agriculture and other rural activities. An estimated 40.5 million people were directly engaged in ASM in 2017, up from 30 million in 2014, 13 million in 1999 and 6 million in 1993.

## Reducing global mercury pollution from small-scale artisanal gold mining
There are now a huge number of small-scale gold miners who scratch a living (literally) from poor-quality gold deposits. One essential step in the process to produce the end product, pure gold, uses mercury to capture the gold mixed in with rock and other minerals. The quantity of mercury released annually by small-scale gold miners alone is estimated to be 3000 tons—37 % of global mercury

## Small Scale Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Small-scale mining and land-based fish processing were important industries historically within PWS, but these were few and scattered (Lethcoe and Lethcoe, 1994).

## Occupational Health Programs for Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining 
This systematic review, conducted as part of the World Health Organization's Global Plan of Action for Workers' Health, sought to assess the state of knowledge on occupational health programs and interventions for the informal artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sector, an occupation which directly employs at least 50 million people.
