## Things You Need to Know About the Ethereum Chip Mining Machine 
The rise of the crypto mining industry has greatly stimulated the development of the mining machine industry. As early as 2013, Bitcoin mining has begun to rely on a special mining machine based on the ASIC chip. For a long time, Ethereum mining is mainly based on GPU, and now it is also beginning to transfer to the ASIC mining machine.

## Emerging Automation in the Coal Mining Industry You Need to Know About 
Automations in the coal mining industry can be applied to two major areas: Automation in process. Automation in software. These automations have started making a place for themselves in the industry; however, they are still in their transition phase. It's still a long way to go for the entire coal mining process to become completely automated.
