## Gold rush? Not for us say Tanzania's small-scale miners
Small-scale miners produce around 20 tonnes of gold per year in Tanzania according to a 2013 report by a parliamentary committee — the latest official tally — but the vast bulk of that is estimated to be illegally exported. The state is hoping that as more licenses are issued, the official trade will grow.

## Tanzania - Mining - International Trade Administration
Mining and quarrying activities had a very large contribution to Tanzania's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the first quarter of 2021. The sector recorded 10.2 percent of the GDP equivalent to 1,473,804 million TZS. The Tanzania mining industry remains attractive to investors, given the next few years of significant diversification to

There are approximately 1.5 million people directly involved in Tanzania's Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) sector.

## Modeling Assessment on Technological Challenges Facing Small-Scale Gold 
However, this study focuses on the costs of that economic growth in gold production over small-scale miners. It is estimated that in the early 1990s, Small-Scale Mining in gold accommodated around 400,000 people in Tanzania. Due to a lack of hard data, this study was based on mostly qualitative fieldwork in Chunya district, Mbeya region, Tanzania.

## Artisanal mining
An artisanal miner or small-scale miner (ASM) is a subsistence miner who is not officially employed by a mining company, but works independently, mining minerals using their own resources, usually by hand.. Small-scale mining includes enterprises or individuals that employ workers for mining, but generally still using manually-intensive methods, working with hand tools.
