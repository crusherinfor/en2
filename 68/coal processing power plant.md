## coal handling and processing plant
The coal handling and processing plant was designed to separate large volumes of high-value coal from rock, old underground mine propping timbers and other waste material, and washing and grading it. The Coal Processing Plant (CPP) was designed to handle between 600,000 tonnes and 1 million tonnes of coal a year.

## Coal based power plant - SlideShare
A thermal power station is a power plant in which the prime mover is steam driven. Water when heated turns into steam which drives a steam turbine. After passing through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated. [Rankine cycle] Coal is used as a fuel to heat water in a coal based thermal power plant.
