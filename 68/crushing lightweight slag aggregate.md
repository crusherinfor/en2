## Development of artificial one-part geopolymer lightweight aggregates by 
The production method of geopolymer lightweight aggregates (GLAs) is explored in this study through crushing technique, which has a good prospect for massive industrial production. Geopolymer cubes with the dimension of 100 mm × 100 mm × 100 mm were firstly produced using one-part geopolymer technology and then crushed into coarse aggregates
