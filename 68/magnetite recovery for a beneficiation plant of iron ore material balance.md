The rate of reduction of both iron ore and quartz varies (Figures 1 to 3). Quartz dissipates easily, breaking down to fines with little applied stress. Though the hardness value of quartz (i.e. 7 on the Mohr's scale) is a bit higher than the iron ore (Hematite (5.5-6.5), Magnetite (5.5-6), it is far more brittle than iron ore (Gribble, 1988).

We offer dry beneficiation plants to up-grade the contaminated hematite iron ores. In the dry beneficiation process, iron ore is ground to 0-2 mm size. After screening, the fines are passed through a very high gauss rare earth magnetic separator (up to 8,000 gauss). A demo plant has been set up & experiments on many types of raw materials were

## Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation - IspatGuru
Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

## beneficiation of iron ore in dry methods
Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru. Apr 03, 2014· Several methods/techniques such as washing, jigging, magnetic separation, gravity separation, and flotation etc. are used to enhance the Fe content of the Iron ore and to reduce its gangue content. These techniques are used in various combinations for the beneficiation of iron ores.

## Beneficiation of magnetite concentrates by flotation
The underfiow product from this froth flotation step was a concentrate containing 65.36% Fe and 6.80% silica, and represented 70.85% by weight of the cell feed. The flotation froth was made up mostly of magnetite-quartz Iniddling grains containing 58.12% Fe and 15.16% silica. This latter froth product was re-ground, in a ball mill, to -200 mesh
