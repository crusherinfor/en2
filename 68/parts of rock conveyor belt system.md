## Designing a Conveyor System - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The Problem with Designing a Conveyor System. The designer of belt conveyors is often faced with problems of determining the proper belt speeds, belt widths, number of plies in the belt, and idler spacing for conveyors employed in various parts of a mill.  Conveyors used in coal, mineral and rock mining require a more sophisticated analysis

## Belt Conveyor - Datasheet | Vention
As an example, a conveyor needs to move a load of 20 kg at 500mm/s up a 10 degree incline. The conveyor must occasionally be able to accelerate the mass at 0.5m/s^2. The width of the belt conveyor is 457mm. In this case our variables are 20kg for mass, 0.5m/s^2 for acceleration, 10 degrees for angle theta, and 120N for deformation force.
