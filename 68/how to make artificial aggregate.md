## Types of Aggregates-Natural and Artificial Aggregates - ReadCivil
Here I am going to write about the types of aggregates based on nature or origin, that is natural aggregate and artificial aggregate. Types of aggregates based on their nature Natural Aggregates. Natural aggregates are found in our environment in different forms. They have different size and shape. They can resist the high compressive load.

Aug 15, 2022Artificial sand, also called crushed sand or mechanical sand (m sand), refers to rocks, mine tailings or industrial waste granules with a particle size of less than 4.75 mm. It is processed by mechanical crushing and sieving. In China, the artificial sand was mainly used in the construction of hydropower systems.

Because aggregate, the most mined resource in the world, is nonrenewable, using RAP conserves the virgin resource itself, as well as the energy and transportation costs that go into obtaining it. In addition, using RAP greatly reduces the amount of construction debris going into landfills. Because RAP can be used again and again, it creates a cycle of asphalt reuse that optimizes.

Abstract: - In this study, the coarse aggregates are completely replaced by fly ash pellets in fly ash concrete. A mix design was provided for M-25 grade of concrete by IS-10262:2009 method. Ordinary Portland cement of 43 grade and fly-ash and water was mixed with proper proportion to make the fly- ash pellets.

## Artificial Grass Drainage Problems and Why They Happen
Bad drainage can make your artificial turf unstable. The appearance of little slopes or grades can be also the result of poor drainage. You can lose the turf's initial look, because excess liquid can deform it. Water can unlevel some parts of the artificial lawn. Mould, mildew and weed growth are encouraged, due to the high moisture levels.

## Performance of Sintered Pozzolanic Artificial Aggregates as Coarse 
The artificial aggregate produced at 950 °C shows the distribution of small pores uniformly, thus reducing the specific gravity value. However, the SGVA sintered at 1000 °C produces pores in bigger sizes and creates pores at the surface of aggregate, thus expanding the original size of aggregate for about 20%.
