## FAM - Crushers - Processing Technology
FAM designed crushers are used for crushing minerals, raw materials and other bulk commodities.. The types of crushing machines are distinguished by their working principles: by pressure, impact, hammer, or shear. In contrast to mills, crushers process the feed materials into grain sizes from coarse to medium granulation.

## Crushing Mineral Processing
The use of hammer mills is in the field of softer minerals, such as gypsum, barytes and limestone, and particularly where the presence of clay would most definitely exclude the use of crushing machines in which fracture of the mineral is effected by pressure. In this latter field in particular, the hammer mill is also used as a primary crusher.

Even for softer ores, like chalcocite and chalcopyrite they have been used as secondary crushers. Choke feeding is not advisable as it tends to produce particles of irregular size.
