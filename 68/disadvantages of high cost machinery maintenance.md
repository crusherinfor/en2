Other key advantages of HSM have been reported as high material removal rates, low cutting forces, and improvement in part precision and surface finish (Fallbohmer et al., 2000). The distinction between conventional and high speed machining is based on the workpiece material being machined, type of cutting operation and the cutting tool used.

## High Speed Machining: Disadvantages | B&B Precision Engineering
In order to machine at high speeds there is much more stopping and starting. This increases the rate of wear in your machine parts such as spindle bearings, ball screws and means higher maintenance cost and the increased risk of machine breakdown. Expensive Inserts. Machining at high speeds means you will need to invest in the right cutting tools.

## Disadvantages
Disadvantages. Containers have flash that must be trimmed and relaimed. Unit cost is significantly higher than injection blown bottles in less than 5 oz. capacity. Operator skill is critical to control container weight and quality.  Because it is generally plastic-based, the mini sewing machine is relatively more easily damaged than a
