Step 1. Make the cement mixture in a bin using one gallon peat, one gallon "Portland" cement, and one gallon perlite. Wear a mask to avoid breathing dust and use gloves when mixing, as concrete can burn the hands. Step 2. Slowly add approximately 2 1/2 quarts of water as if you were making dough, being sure to add the last part of water slowly.

Step 2 - Prepare the cement mix. With the gloves on, you have to mix 3 parts of sand for 1 of cement with a little water in a basin or in a separate bucket. As the amount that is going to be needed to make the cement pot is rather small, it is necessary to pour the water little by little to avoid it being very watery.

## Terracotta VS Concrete Pots For Plants (Which Is Better) - Green Shack
Concrete planter pots are more expensive than terra-cotta. The manufacture of cement is not environmentally friendly. Both terra-cotta and concrete pots can become stained with lime, mosses, and mineral salts on the outside. They are porous. Concrete has a high lime content which may negatively affect some plants.
