Mining in South Africa has been the main driving force behind the history and development of Africa's most advanced and richest economy. Large scale and profitable mining started with the discovery of a diamond on the banks of the Orange River in 1867 by Erasmus Jacobs and the subsequent discovery and exploitation of the Kimberley pipes a few years later.

The Cullinan diamond is discovered at the Premier mine. At 3,106.75ct, it is the largest rough diamond ever found. The Premier mine is later renamed the Cullinan mine. The Cullinan diamond is cut into nine gems. The two biggest are presented to King Edward VII in 1908 and now form part of the British Crown Jewels 1910 Union of South Africa

In some areas of Africa, children make up more than a small part of the workforce. One survey of diamond miners in the Lunda Norte province of Angola found that 46% of miners were between the ages of 5 and 16. For children trapped in the diamond mines, life is full of hardship.
