## A Underground Method of Mining Iron Ore
Rock-filling is now being used in the ninth level, from which 130,000 tons of ore, it is estimated, will be mined this year. The drawings, Figs. 5, 6 and 7, show the method of this filling. From the main shaft " A," a drift cuts the ore-body and 25 feet into the foot-wall of firm jasper-slates.
