## design uranium conversion plant
Barakah Nuclear Power Plant . Uranium One and Rio Tinto were contracted for the supply of natural uranium for the plant. ConverDyn will provide conversion services, while Urenco will provide enrichment services. The enriched uranium will be supplied to Kepco Nuclear Fuels for manufacturing the fuel assemblies for use at the Barakah nuclear plant.

## Expert in uranium conversion and enrichment | Orano
Uranium conversion as a strategic step for reaching "nuclear purity". An essential stage, in the upstream fuel cycle, between the recovery of natural uranium from mines and the enrichment phase, conversion consists of purifying and transforming uranium ore. These conversion and enrichment activities precede the final stage of fuel

## The nuclear fuel cycle - Energy Information Administration
The nuclear fuel cycle consists of front-end steps that prepare uranium for use in nuclear reactors and back-end steps to safely manage, prepare, and dispose of used—or spent—but still highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel.. Uranium is the most widely used fuel by nuclear power plants for nuclear fission. Nuclear power plants use a certain type of uranium—U-235—as fuel because its
