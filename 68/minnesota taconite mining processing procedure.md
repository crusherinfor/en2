Minnesota taconite facilities have been operating for 40 to 50 years. During this time the  Two taconite facilities, Northshore Mining and LTV Mining used soda ash (sodium carbonate) water treatment to "soften" (precipitate calcium carbonate) process water.  The pH of taconite process water is usually very close to pH 8, which is the

Taconite was first discovered in the 1870's in Minnesota, yet at the time was thought to be useless because of the difficulty of extracting high grade iron from the rock. However a process was discovered in the 1940's that made mining taconite profitable and created an economic opportunity for those in the area.

Stauber noted mining has been a dominant industry in Northern Minnesota for more than a century.

McCollum noted there was a carve out in the bill for taconite mining, a traditional Iron Range product.

The taconite is crushed, processed into hard, marble-sized pellets, and shipped to steel mills. The taconite pellets are melted in blast furnaces and then blown with oxygen to make steel. Minnesota currently has seven operating taconite plants which make the pellets. About 44 million tons of taconite pellets were shipped from the state in 1996.

THE PROCESSING OF TACONITE Taconite cannot be used in a blast furnace in its natural state. This fact, combined with the fact that the crude ore contains only about 25 per cent iron, has necessitated the location of processing plants in the mining area, rather than at the steel-mill centers. A huge investment of capital is required.
