## what is open circuit crushing - Welcome to Tables & Thyme
Mar 01, 2021· An open circuit is defined as an electric circuit in which current does not flow. Current can only flow in a circuit if it finds a continuous path—known as a "closed circuit". If there's a break anywhere in the circuit, you have an open circuit, and current can not flow. In an open circuit, the two terminals are disconnected.

## What is the Difference Between an Open Circuit and a Closed Circuit 
The significant distinction between an open circuit and a closed circuit is that in a closed circuit, there is no damaged pathway, whereas the open circuit has at least one broken path. An open circuit is a damage in the pathway of current flow. There are two possible reasons for an open circuit - either there is a damaged cable or it is not
