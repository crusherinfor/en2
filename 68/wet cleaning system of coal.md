##  CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (CCT) - I - IDC-Online
CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (CCT) - I. 1. Introduction - Coal when burned is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. A range of technologies are being used and developed to reduce the environmental impact of coal-fired power stations. Thus, clean coal technology (CCT) is the name attributed to coal chemically washed of minerals and impurities,

The principle of the scrubbing system is that the scrubber picks up suspended particulate matters from the exhaust gases. After that, the gas is cleaned with water or a special solution. The process is based on the intensive mixing of gas and liquid. This cleaning technique is called wet air scrubbing. The size of air pollutants increases due
