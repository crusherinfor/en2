Why is mining good for the economy? Mining activities generate multibillion-dollar revenues for governments. In mining industry contributions to the Australian Government included $24.1 billion in company taxes and $15.2bn to states in royalties. Over the last ten years the industry has paid $239 billion in taxes and royalties.

Unlike fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, minerals are inorganic compounds, meaning they are not formed of animal or plant matter. Canada is abundant in many mineral resources — mined in every province and territory — and a world leader in the production of potash, aluminum, nickel, salt, sulphur and uranium, among others.

The mixing of agencies assigned to handle mining concerns results in overlapping functions. This creates a venue for cracks, which, interestingly, are filled in The Philippine Mining Act is premised on the doctrine that all mineral lands are owned by the state but are open to contractors on the basis of revenue sharing.

## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Mining Industry?
Unrefined materials are released when mineral deposits are exposed on the surface through mining. Wind erosion and nearby vehicular traffic cause such materials to become airborne. Lead, arsenic, cadmium, and other toxic elements are often present in such particles. These pollutants can damage the health of people living near the mining site.
