## How can metal mining impact the environment?
In some cases, bioavailable metals are absorbed by plants and animals, causing detrimental effects. Although current U.S. mining and reclamation practices guided by environmental regulations minimize or prevent waste rock erosion into streams, disposal of waste rock in places where it could erode into surface drainages has occurred historically.

Mining the metal from hard rock is pretty. Lithium mining accounts for less than 10% of freshwater usage and its brine extraction does not correlate with changes in either surface-water features or basin. The environmental impact of traditional mining methods and shipping is also catching the eyes of consumers.

## What Are the Effects of Iron in Water? - Longs Ecowater
Discoloration: If you have high iron levels in your water — usually 0.3 parts per million or more — the water may be a rusty red or brown color. Your water may still be safe to drink, but it will look less appealing. Staining: High concentrations of iron in home water will stain porcelain bathroom fixtures, laundry and dishes.

## Mining and Water Quality | U.S. Geological Survey
Mine drainage is metal-rich water formed from a chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. The resulting chemicals in the water are sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can come out as solids to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage.
