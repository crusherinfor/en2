## Mud Architecture - Construction Details And Techniques
Gravel: alone is of no use for mud wall building - the tiny lumps of stone have nothing to bind them together. Sand: similar to gravel, it is of no use for wall making by itself - but if mixed with clay, it is the ideal mud wall building soil. Silt: by itself is also no good for building walls. It will hold together but is not strong.

Mud in sewer line. New homeowner here. I recently had a sewer clog and upon clearing the drain, the plumber said it was stopped up by mud. The pipe wasn't cracked, there weren't tree roots, it was just soft mud. I live in an urban area that's all concrete and asphalt with no front yards and so I'm not sure how mud would've gotten in there.
