## China tells mines to produce 'as much coal as possible' - CNN
Oct 20, 2021The Chinese government has ordered the country's coal mines to "produce as much coal as possible" as it tries to increase production as winter approaches, and ease an ongoing energy crunch.

## Cost of Production: Fifteen More Lives for Meghalaya's Coal - NewsClick
A low cost of production based on rudimentary equipment as well as cheap labour in terms of a largely migrant workforce has led to the high profitability of mining. It is no surprise that despite the NGT's Order in April, 2014, banning all mining in Meghalaya is going to be near impossible until the government comes up with a proper plan.

The average cost for mining one tonne of hard coal in Germany is 180 euros; the price for imported hard coal was between 86 and 96 euros per tonne in 2017. Because of this hard coal mining has been subsidised by the state since the 1960s. The sector has received 337 billion euros between 1970 and 2016, according to Green Budget Germany ( FÖS ).

Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit
