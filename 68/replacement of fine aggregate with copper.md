## Replacement of Cement and Fine Aggregate by Ceramic Powder and Copper 
On behalf ofutilization of industrial waste as well to minimize the construction material cost, some materials can replace the by-product of concrete. In this study we have chosen ceramic powder and copper slag as a replacement of cement and fine aggregate. More studies were carried out replacing cement but ceramic powder and replacing fine
