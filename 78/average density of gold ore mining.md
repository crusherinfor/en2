The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold.

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## At what concentration (ppm) is gold profitable for extraction?
Answer (1 of 5): As a rule of thumb, you could say 1.5g/t for ipen cut and 6-8g/t for underground but there are so many factors, most importantly, the recovery factor (gravity separation is cheap/easy), contained gold content and depth of mining. There is often a grade x volume of ore trade off.
