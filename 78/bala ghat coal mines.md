## Metallurgical coal | BHP
Metallurgical (met) coal (or coking coal) is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock found within the earth's crust. Categories of met coal include hard coking coal, semi-hard coking-coal, semi-soft coking coal and pulverised coal for injection (PCI). These apply to the different quality grades of met coal, all of which are used to make steel.
