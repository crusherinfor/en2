In my research and experience with grinding my own grains, I've come across two types of mills. The most common for using in a home kitchen: an impact mill and a stone mill. Impact mill: This grain mill is made up of stainless steel blades that move incredibly fast, bursting the grains into small pieces as they hit the mill.

Impact. Stone Grinders are the oldest type of grinder there is and was the only kind until only a few years ago. Stonegrinders have two circular grinding stones. One stone turns against a stationary stone. Grooves are cut, radiating out from the center of the stone. These grooves diminish until they disappear towards the outer edges.

## Difference in Sharpening Stone Materials
The difference between a water stone and an oil stone is the binder that holds the abrasives together. Water stones are softer than oil stones. This softer binder promotes faster cutting because the old abrasive material breaks away and is replaced with fresh sharp material. Fast cutting is a clear an advantage of the water stone.
