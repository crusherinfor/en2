In the cement industry, the fuels combusted to heat the kiln account for about 40% of total cement manufacturing emissions. The remaining 60% are "process emissions" — i.e. when limestone is super heated. The Cement Division is pursuing a variety of innovative measures to further reduce the industry's carbon footprint.
