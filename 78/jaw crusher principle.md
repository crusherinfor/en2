## WORKING PRINCIPLE OF JAW CRUSHER
The jaw crusher is simple in structure, easy to manufacture and reliable in operation. The working part of the jaw crusher consists of two jaws, one is a fixed jaw (fixed jaw), which is fixed vertically (or slightly inclined at the upper end) on the front wall of the machine body, and the other is a movable jaw (moving jaw). It is inclined to

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws. The moving jaw moves back and forward against the fixed jaw, and material fed from the top of the machine is compressed

## how a jaw crusher works and what it is used for
A Jaw Crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws (feed opening). For instance, a 24 x 36 jaw crusher has a opening of 24" by 36", a 56 x 56 jaw crusher has a opening of 56" square.
