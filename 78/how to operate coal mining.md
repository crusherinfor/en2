After 20 years, you would have to mine 5 times as material to keep the coal plant operating, compared to the wind power, and the ratio keeps improving as long as you run the wind turbines. Newer turbines are rated to last 25 to even 40 years. In addition, I looked at the issue of lithium vs coal. One trope from the anti-clean energy tribe is

Planning Process. Once all the exploration information is available, planning can begin in earnest, though often it begins while the exploration process is still in progress. The start of the planning process is the elimination of any parts of the lease which cannot be worked at all or cannot be readily mined for whatever reason.

The coal mining sector encompasses all coal mining operations, both open cut and underground which operate either as stand-alone extraction units or they are tied-in with specific thermal power plants or other coal consumers. Risk is defined as the measure of the probability and severity of business adverse effects (Lowrance, 1976).

Some firms have already responded, with UK-Swiss mining firm Glencore, which operates several coal mines in Australia, announcing last week that it now expects its thermal coal costs to be $42/t, down from previous guidance of $45/t in 2020. It expects costs to fall to an average of $40/t in the second half of the year from $44/t in the first half.

## How Coal Works | Union of Concerned Scientists
Since the predominantly subbituminous coal west of the Mississippi emits much less sulfur per unit of energy, this trend favored western surface mines as a dominant source of new coal production. It also increased the use of mountaintop-removal mining in Central Appalachia for the same reasons—a classic example of unintended consequences.
