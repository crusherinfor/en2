## From Ore to Finished Product - Copper
Copper - From Beginning to End. Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man. It is found in ore deposits around the world. It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago. And as alloyed in bronze (copper-tin alloy) about 3000 BC, was the first engineering material known to man.

## Copper Ore Mining Methods
Teck's Red Dog surface zinc mine adds US$ million annually through blast monitoring. Centerra Gold's Mount Milligan open cast copper mine recovered over US$600,000 of ore in one blast. Anaconda Mining's Pine Cove gold mine reduced dilution from 20% to less than 5% and generated a 15% increase in recovered tonnes, valued at US$15-30k

## Copper Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Copper ore usually contains about 0.5 to 2% copper that occurs in the form of disseminated and stringers. The run of mine ore is reduced from 150 mm to 25 mm size in Jaw and Cone crushers. The crushed ore is grinded in ball mills to −74 μm size. The ore is processed by froth flotation comprising rougher and scavenger cells.

## Copper Ore Mining Hazards | Axora
One major concern of copper mining is the inhalation of silica dust particles, which leads to the development of silicosis, pneumoconiosis, or tuberculosis. Mining for copper sulphide ore, like chalcopyrite, is particularly hazardous to human health because of the number of toxins it releases, including methylmercury, lead, arsenic, asbestos
