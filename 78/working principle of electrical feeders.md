Feb 24, 2022A vibratory feeder is a machine that maximises vibration and gravity in feeding and moving the materials into other machines. Vibration typically handles the movement of the materials by imparting a mixture of horizontal and vertical acceleration. Gravity, alternatively, somehow counters the acceleration from the vibration so it can establish

## Working Principle of a Transformer
The working of the transformer is based on the principle of mutual inductance between two coils which are magnetic coupled. According to the principle of mutual inductance, when an alternating voltage is applied to the primary winding of the transformer, an alternating flux ϕ m which is called as the mutual flux is produced in the core.
