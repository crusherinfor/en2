Figure 4 illustrates a coal pulverizer. Coal is supplied through a central fuel feeding pipe, and the centrifugal force of a rotating pulverizing table causes the coal to move to the outer edges of the table. There, coal is pulverized by being ground between pulverizing rollers and the table. Pulverized coal and coal .

How is coal carried from storage place to broilers in a power plant? The Coal Mills or pulverizer pulverizes the coal to 200 mesh size. The powdered coal from the coal mills is carried to the boiler in coal pipes by high pressure hot air. The pulverized coal air mixture is burnt in the boiler in the combustion zone.
