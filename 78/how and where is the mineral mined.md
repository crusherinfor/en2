## Mineral Extraction - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Mineral extraction sites, which include strip mines, quarries, and underground mines, contribute to surface water and groundwater pollution, erosion, and sedimentation (see Chapter 14). The mining process involves the excavation of large amounts of waste rock in order to remove the desired mineral ore (Fig. 12.6). The ore is then crushed into

The minerals are valuable for a number of industries. Sodium chloride is table salt. Potassium (potash) is a key ingredient in fertilizer and is used in a number of other industrial processes. China's largest potassium production industry, including the Qinghai potash fertilizer plant, is centered around Lake Qarhan.

The primary methods used to extract minerals from the ground are: Underground mining. Surface (open pit) mining. Placer mining. The location and shape of the deposit, strength of the rock, ore grade, mining costs, and current market price of the commodity are some of the determining factors for selecting which mining method to use.

For both traditional underground and open pit mining, the rocks may have only a few percent (normally <0.3%) uranium in them. The uranium then has to be removed from the rock and concentrated. The milling process involves crushing and pulverizing the rock into very fine fragments and adding water to create a slurry.
