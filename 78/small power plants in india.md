## How to build a commercial solar power plant in India? - The Economic Times
A popular way of providing electricity drawn from solar energy is to set up a commercial solar power plant in India. Working of solar power plant Typically, the working of a solar power plant comprises a bank of solar panels receiving sun's energy which is converted into DC electric power by photovoltaic (PV) effect produced by the PV cells

## What are the different types of power plants used to generate energy?
Geothermal power plants. The three main types of geothermal plants include dry steam power stations, flash steam power stations and binary cycle power stations, all of which use steam turbines to produce electricity. The installed capacity of geothermal energy has gradually increased worldwide over the past decade, up from just short of 10 GW

## Power Plant: What Are They? (& the Types of Power Plants)
Therefore the 3 major classifications for power production in reasonably large scale are: Thermal power generation. Nuclear power generation. Hydro-electric power generation. Apart from these major types of power generations, we can resort to small scale generation techniques as well, to serve the discrete demands.
