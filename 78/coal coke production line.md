## Coke Fuel: Production and Applications - Bluestone Coke
Coke fuel production begins by heating coal in the absence of air. This carbonization process breaks down coal into its primary constituents: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur. The next step in coke fuel production is crushing and washing the coal to remove impurities. The coal is then fed into a coke oven heated to approximately 1,800

Workers at coking plants and coal-tar production plants may be exposed to coke oven emissions. Occupational exposures can also occur among workers in the aluminum, steel, graphite, electrical, and construction industries. The primary routes of potential human exposure to coke oven emissions are inhalation and absorption through the skin.

## Coking Coal for steel production and alternatives - Front Line Action 
By Noah Beecher Kelk Metallurgical coal, also called metcoal or coking coal, is a type of coal that is used in the production of steel. It is of a higher purity than thermal coal which is used in energy generation. To make steel, metcoal is heated at around 1100 degrees C to remove water and other chemicals. This is done without the presence of oxygen. The result is a lump of near-pure carbon

## How a Coke Plant Works - GASP
Coal is the main ingredient used to make coke. Iron is produced by inputting coal into a blast furnace. However, coal cannot be put directly into a blast furnace because of all the harmful by-products that come from that. So, there is an intermediate process that occurs. Coal is converted into coke first. Coke is used as fuel in a blast furnace.

## Coal Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Coal production continues to grow globally due to the demand for low cost energy and iron and steel, as well as cement. Coal, based on the current extraction rates, will last about 115 years longer than conventional oil and gas reserves, with an estimated 1.1 trillion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide. Ten countries are responsible for 90% of the total global coal production.

Technological Process. Petroleum coke needs to be crushed to a certain degree of fineness before it is calcined in rotary kiln, so that it can be calcined in a uniform depth. But it should not be too fine to prevent excessive powder and increase calcination loss. The calcined petroleum coke is fed into the main grinding room for grinding.

## COKE PRODUCTION - Chemical Agents and Related Occupations - NCBI Bookshelf
Coke was first produced commercially in England in the early eighteenth century. By the early to mid-1800s, coke was being widely produced in Europe and the United States of America as the major fuel for blast furnaces.
