## Maceration extraction method - Big Chemical Encyclopedia
Maceration A method of extracting materials, such as herbs, by soaking the plant material in water or alcohol for several days. The resulting material is called a tincture when ethanol is used. Tinctures were traditionally used in pharmaceuticals and perfumes but are practically obsolete now (see also Infused oil). [Pg.280]

## The Basic Scientific Principles of Solvent Extraction | Aptia Engineering
The principle behind solvent extraction is extremely basic. The goal is to use a liquid ( solvent) to dissolve ( solvate) a target molecule or group of compounds ( solute) and to wash them out of the solid plant material. The solvent is then separated from the solute in order to concentrate the solute. This separation is usually achieved by

## Soxhlet Extraction Method- Estimation Of Fat In Food
There are two ways to find out the fat present in food, either by acid hydrolysis or by solvent extraction. The solvent extraction method is more pronouncedly known as Soxhlet method. It came into the scene in 1897. This method is widely used in almost all food industries and primarily used in oil extraction industries.

It is considered a rugged extraction method because there are very few variables that can adversely affect extraction efficiency.
