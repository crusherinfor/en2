## Sidewinder Conveyor Design Software
Integrated System Design. Many conveyor systems have a wide range of operating conditions. These include variations in:  As belt tensions are often highest at the head pulley, belt edged stresses in these areas are also the highest in the belt. However, many conveyor design calculation programs ignore these areas.
