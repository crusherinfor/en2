## Coal Mine Water Drainage: The Current Status and Challenges
Any form of mining is a potential threat to the environment. The extent of environmental degradation depends on the status of mine (working/abandoned), type of deposit, mining and processing methods and the geo-atmospheric conditions. Coal mining has huge impacts to local water resources, both surface and ground water. Surface waters are being contaminated through the discharge of mine water

The collapse of the coal mining industry has already begun and has only accelerated during the coal-friendly Trump administration. Although the industry weathered a string of major bankruptcies from 2015 to 2018 without seeing a significant increase in mine abandonments, those bankruptcies merely set the stage for the current crisis.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## Analysis of methane and coal dust explosion at two stage  - AusIMM
A dust explosion in an underground coal mine consists of two explosions, namely a primary explosion and a secondary explosion. The primary explosion usually occurs in methane gas, causing waves along the air way and the dispersion of dust. The second explosion occurs due to the concentration of coal dust and methane in the explosive range and is triggered by first explosion.
