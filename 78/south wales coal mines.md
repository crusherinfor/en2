## How many coal mines are in Wales? - Origin of coal
How many coal mines were in South Wales? Steady increases in output and manpower meant that the early 20th century gave Wales its peak production figures. No less than 57m tons of coal was produced in 1913, by 232,000 men working in 620 mines. The largest number of men ever to work in the Welsh coal mines was 271,000 in 1920.
