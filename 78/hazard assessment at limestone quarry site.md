## Stability Assessment of the Slopes of an Oceanside Coral Limestone 
Vipingo quarry in Kilifi county, Kenya, is one of the quarries supplying coral limestone for limestone manufacturing in the coastal region. Due to its close proximity to the Indian ocean, the semidiurnal ocean tides tend to have an influence on the stability of the quarry slopes adjacent to the shoreline. Finite element numerical analysis using the generalized Hoek-Brown criterion is

## Stability Assessment of the Slopes of an Oceanside Coral Limestone 
A parametric analysis shows that there is no significant effect of the tides on slope stability for excavations above the water table, but as the quarry gets deeper, the slope stability is affected. A sensitivity factor (ζ) is introduced, being a measure of how much the slope safety factor is reduced as a result of the semidiurnal tidal action.
