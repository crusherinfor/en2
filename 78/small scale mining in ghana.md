## Troubled waters: Artisanal mining and livelihoods in Ghana
Not all small-scale mining in Ghana is illegal. In fact, Ghana was the first sub-Saharan African country to pass legislation regulating ASM back in 1989. Currently, the Minerals and Mining Act of 2006 contains provisions for small-scale mining including registration, permits, health and safety, and environmental management.

## Small-Scale Mining Business In Ghana: Challenges And Prospects
Small-scale mining is essentially an artisanal or small industrial form of raw material extraction. In Ghana, there are about 300 registered small-scale mining groups and they constitute a major source of employment especially for small-scale gold and diamond miners, and contribute some foreign exchange to Ghana's economy.
