## Wet sieving versus dry crushing: Soil microaggregates reveal different 
The sand-sized and silt-sized particles within aggregates are dispersed during wet sieving. Therefore, aggregates in wet-sieved size fractions contain more clay-sized and silt-sized particles. If the aim of aggregate isolation is to isolate intact structures including sand-sized primary particles, dry crushing can be recommended.

Sand and gravel are naturally occurring materials shaped by the water in which it is formed and transported. Erosion and weathering render the stone round instead of angular. This shape is the principle difference between crushed stone and sand and gravel. About 44% of construction sand and gravel is used as concrete aggregates, 25% for road.
