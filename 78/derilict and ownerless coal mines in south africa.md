This is also the case for South Africa, which has a mature mining industry, dating back to the 1860's. Its mineral wealth has largely facilitated the development of the country. However, the legacy of past mining practices has not always been positive and South Africa is faced with addressing the impacts of almost 6000 recorded abandoned mines.
