Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined often via smelting to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains. How does iron ore get mined? Most iron ores are extracted by surface mining.Some underground mines do exist but wherever possible surface mining is preferred because it is cheaper.
