## Algae-grown limestone could be the key to 'carbon negative' cement 
The algae create calcium carbonate, which can be used as a replacement for quarried limestone in cement production. The real reason why algae-derived 'biogenic' limestone is a gamechanger, is the fact that heating it only releases carbon dioxide that was previously extracted from the atmosphere during the algae's lifetime. The net effect

Limestone can be categorized as either high calcium or dolomitic. Pure high-calcium limestone is 100 percent calcium carbonate (100 percent calcite or aragonite). Generally, limestone of this purity does not occur naturally. High-quality, high-calcium limestone would actually contain 97 to 99 percent calcium carbonate and 1 to 3 percent impurities.
