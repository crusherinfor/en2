20° idlers, (1-1/2) belt widths for 35° idlers, and (2) times the belt width for 45° trough idlers. It is good practice to use a 20° trough idler as a transition idler for the first and last idler when using a 35° conveyor system. For 45° conveyor systems use both 20° and 35° transition idlers. Place idlers in position by sliding them

At the upper side of the conveyor also called the carrying side, because the pay load is carried on this side, the belt is supported by idler. At the other side also called the return side because usually there is no pay load, the belt is supported by idlers. In some designs the belt is supported by a stationery runway instead of idlers.

## Designing a Conveyor System - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The designer of belt conveyors is often faced with problems of determining the proper belt speeds, belt widths, number of plies in the belt, and idler spacing for conveyors employed in various parts of a mill. Equipment Company offers the following data and tables, based upon many years of experience in designing all types of mills, to assist

## Design, Analysis and Optimisation of Belt Conveyor for Coal  - IJERT
In order to optimize the conveyor equipment for efficient performance these parameters are reduced such as Reduction of motor frame vibrations to 11. - 16 Hz, reducing idler deflection to less than 5 mm, maximum shaft deflection to be achieved less than 1 mm, reduce the belt capacity to 31 TPH, reduce the overall conveyor weight to 0.9 TON.
