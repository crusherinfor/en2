All raw materials are melted in a furnace reaching temperatures of up to 1600°C. It can take up to two days for the materials to melt appropriately before the bottles can be made. The liquid glass is directed further into the feeder and at this point the forming process can begin. Glass gobs are cut off where they can then enter the moulds.
