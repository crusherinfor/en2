The lapping process is more gentle than honing and removes much less surface material. Therefore, the workpiece should be as close as possible to final size — achieved, for example, through double-disk grinding — because lapping typically removes only 0.0005" to 0.005" (0.0127 mm to 0.127 mm) of material.
