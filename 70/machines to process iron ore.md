Step 1 - The iron making process . As iron is the main component of steel it firstly needs to be made. Iron ore, lime, and coke are placed into a blast furnace and melted. The resulting liquid known as molten iron is then formed. As molten iron still contains around 4% - 4.5% impurities such as carbon which in turn make the metal brittle.

Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
