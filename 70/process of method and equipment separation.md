## Magnetic Separation Method - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Magnetic Separation Method. Magnetic separation is a process used to separate materials from those that are less or non­magnetic. All materials have a response when placed in a magnetic field, although with most, the effect is too slight to be detected. The few materials that are strongly affected (magnetised) by magnetic fields are known as
