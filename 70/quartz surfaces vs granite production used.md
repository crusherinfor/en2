## Manmade quartz vs graniteall-held
Man-made quartz does not need sealing because of the way it is made. Quartzite, on the other hand, is less prone to scratching and can also withstand heat slightly better than quartz . When it comes to costs, quartzite is generally slightly more expensive than quartz because it needs to be cut into slabs to meet the specifications of each.

## Quartz Versus Granite Countertops: Pros and Cons - SKY MARBLE
While granite is more heat-resistant than quartz, it does require a bit more upkeep. Granite is a porous stone, which means that it needs to be sealed and regularly resealed. It's still relatively low-maintenance, but quartz is virtually no maintenance. As a non-porous stone, it doesn't need sealing—just regular cleaning will suffice to

This creates countertops that are durable without pores or cracks and the pigment used is naturally found in quartz arenite. Granite and Radon. There have been online sources reporting that granite countertops may contain radon, a radioactive gas that is naturally found in the stone. Granites can contain radon in parts per billion, but the
