## beneficiation of phosphorus from iron ore
Australia's iron ore industry is undergoing a major transformation. Reserves of traditional high-grade ores are becoming depleted while the replacement ore types are lower in grade and sometimes require beneficiation to remove or minimise contamits such as alumina, silica and phosphorus (Dukino et al., 2000).The phosphorus content of .

## Roasting-induced phase change and its influence on phosphorus removal 
In the present study, roasting-induced phase change and its influence on phosphorus removal via leaching has been investigated for high-phosphorus iron ore. The findings indicate that phosphorus in the ore is associated with goethite and exists mainly in amorphous Fe3PO7 phase. The phosphorus remains in the amorphous phase after being roasted below 300°C. Grattarolaite (Fe3PO7) is found in

Aluminum is a lightweight metal and its alloys are used in the aerospace industry. These alloys are used for making bodies of aircrafts and to form high strength parts for jet engines. These parts deal with the extremities of temperature, pressure and vibration. They provide high strength and the ability to function at very high temperatures.

Heating the ore and leaching with 40 g/L NaOH lowered the phosphorous levels from 0.145 wt per cent P to 0.075 wt per cent P or lower, but a heating temperature over 800C was required to achieve this reduction in phosphorous levels. However, when sodium hydroxide was added to the iron ore before the heat treatment, similar phosphorous removal

High-phosphorus iron ore is traditionally dephosphorized by chemical process with inorganic acids. However, this process is not recommended nowadays because of its high cost and consequent environmental pollution.  and the maximum percentages of phosphate removal were recorded at temperature 27-30 °C, initial pH 5.0-6.5, particle size 0.07

Phosphorous is typically present in iron ore either in the mineral apatite, Ca5(PO4)3OH, or associated with the goethitic fraction of the ore. In this paper, we present results that show that phosphorous associated with the goethitic fraction can be removed with a heating pretreatment around 300C for 1 h, followed by a caustic leach with 1 - 5 M NaOH, or a leach with sulfuric acid at pH 0.5.
