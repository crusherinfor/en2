## China's Bauxite Investment in Ghana Already Proving Damaging to 
Bauxite extraction is highly damaging to the environment, despite assurances to the contrary by the Ghanaian government. Reaching the metal requires strip-mining the topsoil, which in turn requires the removal of forest cover. Deforestation increased by 60 percent from 2017 to 2018 in preparation for Ghana's first bauxite mine.

## Major manufacturing companies oppose mining in Atewa Forest, Ghana 
In late 2016, the Ghanaian government initiated plans to mine bauxite found beneath Atewa Forest as part of a financial deal with China. Extracting bauxite in Atewa would require 'strip mining' where the whole surface layer of soil is removed. This means a total loss of the forest in the mined areas, along with all the biodiversity it contains.
