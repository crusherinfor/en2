Limestone rocks vary in densities depending on their rock sizes. Smaller pieces of limestone rocks have higher bulk density than larger size limestone rocks. If you know the density of the limestone rock you plan to use, you can change the density value in the Average density variable. The average density of limestone is 1.55-2.75 g/cm³.
