## Coal in Virginia
Mining started there in 1983, and it grew into the largest metallurgical coal mine in Virginia. By 2022, 25% of Virginia's remaining 2,000 coal miners were employed there and the Buchanan Mine Complex was producing 40% of Virginia's coal. the Buchanan Mine is underground, but a tailings pile is visible on the surface.

## Coal mining in Colorado
Colorado is the tenth largest coal-producing state in the country. In 2014, Colorado mines produced 21.8 million metric tons (24.0 million short tons) of coal, and employed 2,069 miners. Most Colorado coal is used for electric power generation. Eleven coal mines operate in Colorado, including eight underground mines in Delta, Garfield, Gunnison

Below the densely forested slopes of the Appalachian Mountains in southern West Virginia is a layer cake of thin coal seams. To uncover this coal profitably, mining companies engineer large—sometimes very large—surface mines. This time-series of images of a surface mine in Boone County, West Virginia, illustrates why this controversial mining method is also called "mountaintop removal."

The most controversial mines are known as mountaintop removal mines because coal companies literally remove the tops of mountains with dynamite and earth-moving machines, called draglines, in order to reach coal seams. The waste rock—the remains of the mountains—is piled into neighboring hollows in towering earthen dams called valley fills.
