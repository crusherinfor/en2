## Quartz Mineral | Photos, Uses, Properties, Pictures - Geology
Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen, with a chemical composition of SiO 2. It is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and is resistant to both chemical and physical weathering. When rocks weather away, the residual material usually contains quartz. This is why the sand at most of the world's beaches is quartz.

Quartz is a widely distributed mineral of several varieties that primarily consists of silicon dioxide (SiO2) or silica. Minor impurities such as sodium, lithium, titanium, and potassium can be present. This mineral has attracted more attention from the earliest times; ancient Greeks know water-clear crystals as krystallos.
