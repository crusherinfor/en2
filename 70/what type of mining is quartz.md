## Where quartz is found? Explained by FAQ Blog
Wegner Quartz Crystal Mine, Arkansas. How can you tell if a rock is quartz? You can recognize it by these identifiers: A glassy luster. Hardness 7 on the Mohs scale, scratching ordinary glass and all types of steel. It breaks into curved shards rather than flat-faced cleavage fragments, meaning it exhibits conchoidal fracture.

## 11 of the world's most dangerous minerals - Mining Technology
Since the dawn of humanity, the world's most dangerous minerals endangered the lives of iron age peoples. In the industrial revolution, miners quickly learned about the risks of rocks, acting as the proverbial 'canary in the coal mine' for later safety advances. Many minerals create an invisible hazard in dust form, as detailed in Reviews in Mineralogy.

## Mining History and Geology of the California Gold Rush
At least eight of the mines boasted total production in excess of 1,000,000 ounces. Overall, hardrock mining accounted for about 60% of the gold produced in the Mother Lode and Sierra Foothills. The most serious problem of mining the gold veins themselves was that quartz, the host ore, was an extremely hard mineral.

What is quartz worth? Quartz's clarity earns it a raw price of around $0.01/carat and a gem price of $1-$7/carat. Amethyst, or purple quartz, is the most valuable variety (can reach $15/carat), but pink, rose, and smokey quartz is also valuable. Clearer, more vibrant, and unbroken specimens are the most valuable quartz.

## How to find gold in quartz rock specimens - Gold Rush Nuggets
Check the tailing piles and waste rock near the entrance of mine openings. Remember that gold miners didn't have metal detectors hundreds of years ago, so it was easy to overlook gold that was peeking out of a piece of quartz. Another interesting thing to consider is that back then it took a lot of gold to be worth the effort to process.

## Quartz | Common Minerals
Quartz was the mineral upon which the Stone Ages were based. With few exceptions, most early stone tools were fashioned of quartz. Outcrops of quartz that were suitable for tool manufacturing were targeted by some of the earliest known mining activities and the mined quartz was traded across vast distances, even before humans began to establish agricultural societies.
