Mill capacity and the stirring speeds were the investigated parameters for the open circuit tests, whereas closed circuit tests were carried out at a constant stirring speed but variable discharge rate. Five speed levels used in the open circuit grinding tests are 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 rpm.

The advantage of closed circuit system is eliminating over grinding phenomenon and reducing temperature of grinding chamber. Then the grinding efficiency and capacity is improved. In general, the capacity can be improved by 10%-20% compared with cement mill when these specifications are similar. And capacity can be improved by 30% when grinding

## open grinding and closed grinding - Mining
Open and closed circuit dry grinding of cement mill. Mill capacity and the stirring speeds were the investigated parameters for the open circuit tests, whereas closed circuit tests were carried out at a constant stirring speed but variable discharge rate. Five speed levels used in the open circuit grinding tests are 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 rpm.
