## How Microsoft uses process mining to accelerate digital transformation
Process mining is accelerating digital transformation by providing tools to optimize operations using intelligent processes. This accelerates our business responsiveness, improves service levels, and reduces costs. We want to coordinate people and assets more efficiently, respond to issues in real time, and even solve them preemptively.

## Lead Mining - Concentration process, flotation, filtering, roasting 
Lead is extracted from ores dug from under-ground mines. Lead is also found in conjunction with other metals such as silver and zinc. Lead materials are mined as a by- product of these other more valuable metals. Extracting the lead materials from the ore is a tedious process. First the lead ore is ground into small salt-like particles.

Most of the silver produced today is a byproduct of mining copper, lead, and zinc. The silver occurs within the ores of these metals in one of two ways: 1) substituting for one of the metal ions within the ore mineral's atomic structure; or, 2) occurring as an inclusion of native silver or a silver mineral within the ore mineral.
