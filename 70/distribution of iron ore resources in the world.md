## distribution of iron ore
Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.

## Iron Ore Distribution across the World - PMF IAS
Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.
