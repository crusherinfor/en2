## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Impacts of strip mining: Strip mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees, plants, and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways.

Fortunately, the environmental impact of that process can be somewhat balanced out by post-mining rehabilitation, eﬃcient recycling, and generally reducing our consumption. The Process: Bauxite to Alumina to Aluminum. Aluminum is hidden in an ore called Bauxite. It's a red dirt and clay mixture commonly found in Australia, Brazil, and India.

## How can metal mining impact the environment?
In some cases, bioavailable metals are absorbed by plants and animals, causing detrimental effects. Although current U.S. mining and reclamation practices guided by environmental regulations minimize or prevent waste rock erosion into streams, disposal of waste rock in places where it could erode into surface drainages has occurred historically.

## The Potential Negative Effects Of Mining On The Environment, Animals 
In some countries, mining is responsible for significant amounts of water use, as well as water waste. Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants.

## The environmental impact of ancient iron mining and smelting on Elba 
Elba Island was a hotspot of iron mining and smelting in Italy since Etruscan times (6th century BCE). Whereas the environmental burden of modern (base) metal mining in Tuscany is well studied, the impact of both ancient iron mining and smelting on soils in the region is poorly understood. Therefore, we took soil samples from an ancient smelting site and adjacent areas to evaluate the release

## Question: What are the environmental impacts of mining iron ore in 
What are the environmental impacts of iron ore mining? The mining of iron ore is highly energy intensive and causes air pollution in the form of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from diesel generators, trucks and other equipment. The mining of iron ore also causes water pollution of heavy metals and acid that drains from the mines.

## A clearer look at how iron reacts in the environment
ARGONNE, ILL. (Sept. 6, 2012) — Using ultrafast X-rays, scientists for the first time have watched how quickly electrons hop their way through rust nanoparticles. This gives key insight to how iron oxide, one of the most abundant minerals in soil, behaves and alters the condition of soil and water around it. This also demonstrates the potential of time-resolved X-ray and optical methods to
