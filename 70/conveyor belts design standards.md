Pipe Conveyor Design. In pipe conveyors, the belt is rolled into a tube. These conveyors can negotiate tight curves and keep the material isolated from the environment. Our engineers invented a special carcass construction that is used by leading belt manufacturers to ensure the pipe is stable in horizontal curves (US Patent USB2).

The width of the belt conveyor is 457mm. In this case our variables are 20kg for mass, 0.5m/s^2 for acceleration, 10 degrees for angle theta, and 120N for deformation force.

## Factors to Consider When Designing Conveyor I
The dimension and type of the conveyor belt determine the driven and driver pulley diameter. The essence of having the right diameter is to ensure that no undue stress is put on the belt in times of operation. The length from the center pulley accounts for the length of the belt, considering the distance parallel to the belt line.

The loads and load combinations, however, can create some interesting discussions.
