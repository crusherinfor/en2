## Beneficiation Methods of 5 Kinds of Iron Ore | Mining Pedia
Jun 28, 2022Hematite ore is a weak magnetic iron ore, and many beneficiation methods can be used, including gravity separation, flotation, strong magnetic separation, roasting magnetic separation and the combined process of several methods. In recent years, combined processes with both parallel and series combinations have been widely used.

## iron ore-MECRU
Single magnetite beneficiation The composition of iron ore of a single type of magnetite is simple, the proportion of magnetite in iron minerals is very large, and the gangue minerals are mostly quartz and silicate minerals. According to production practice research, weak magnetic separation methods are often used for separation., In large and medium-sized magnetic separation plants, the ore
