Most of the iron ore mined today is a banded sedimentary rock known as taconite that contains a mixture of magnetite, hematite, and chert. Once considered a waste material, taconite became an important ore after higher grade deposits were depleted. Today's commercial taconites contain 25 to 30% iron by weight.

## beneficiation of taconite ore
The tonnage of taconite ores processed annually by magnetic separation skill, in a couple of years, reaches 100 million. Magnetic separation occupies an attractive position in ore beneficiation. This is a simple effective method, used for some 150 many steadily growing more valuable. This kind of beneficiation originated from 1792, when William
