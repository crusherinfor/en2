Gold in quartz. R30020. Source: Geoscience Australia.  In refractory ore the gold is locked in sulphide minerals, so to achieve satisfactory levels of gold recovery additional processing is required before cyanidation. Sulphide minerals in refractory ores are converted to oxides by either roasting or biological leaching to release the gold.

Gold-Bearing Quartz is one of the world's rarest forms of natural gold. It is found underground by hard rock miners in only a few locations in the world. This unique formation is being mined 1,500 to 2,500 feet below the earth's surface. The natural veins of gold were formed by hydrothermal pressure deep within the earth millions of years ago.

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.
