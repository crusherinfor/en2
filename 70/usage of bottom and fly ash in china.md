West Virginia produces about 10% of US coal. When coal is burned to produce electricity, a by-product - coal ash - is created. Coal ash consists of fly ash and bottom ash. Fly ash is made up of the lightweight particles captured by the power plant's electrostatic precipitators and baghouses, making fly ash a very fine powder.
