## Chemical Processing of Phosphate - Florida Poly
Chemical Processing of Phosphate. The phosphate mineral as it exists in the ground is not soluble and is hard for the plant to access. To provide the plant with the phosphate it needs, in a form it can take up through its roots, the phosphate rock is converted to phosphoric acid. It is that acid that is used to make fertilizer.

## Unconventionally Mining Phosphorus from Wastewater
Many facilities, and perhaps the case could be made to suggest "most" of the 16,000+ treatment plants in the United States, employ a form of chemical precipitation that serves to bind dissolved phosphorus to a metal salt or rare earth elements (e.g. - ferric chloride, alum or cerium chloride).

There are 27 phosphate mines in Florida, covering nearly half a billion acres. Phosphate pebbles were found in the Peace River in the 1880's, setting off a mining rush where Hardee, Hillsborough, Manatee, and Polk counties meet. "Bone Valley" was named for the large number of prehistoric fossils found there.

## Phosphate Mining - Biological Diversity
Most mining of phosphate rock involves clearing large swaths of vegetation and digging up the soil beneath to reach the phosphate-ore-containing matrix 60 to 80 feet below the surface. This matrix is then transported by pipeline to a nearby plant, where the phosphate ore is forcibly separated from the sand and clay by a process known as

Locally, phosphate is popularly concentrated and mined in Central Florida, which is also called the "Bone Valley". In the process of mining, phosphate is mixed with water using high-powered water guns to create a slurry. It is then pumped to the beneficiary plant, wherein the phosphate is separated from the sand and clay.
