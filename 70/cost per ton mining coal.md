##  Underground Coal Mining: Factors, Cost, and Time Considerations
• Until the early 1970's, the majority of coal production in the U.S. was via underground mining methods. • Advancements in technology (primarily hydraulics and explosives) and expansion of mining activities in the west (particularly in the PRB), have shifted mining trends from underground to surface production over the past 40 years.
