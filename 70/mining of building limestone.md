## what the method of mining Limestone - fabioclass knowlege home
Limestone is mined by a method called quarrying. In this method,the overburden rocks scrapped off with mechanical excavators in order to reach the limestone. The limestone is then shattered with explosives and scooped out by the excavators into trucks waiting t carry it to the factory. 161. LIVER FLUKE.

## Limestone, Shell, Dolomite - Florida Department of Environmental Protection
An Environmental Resource Permit (ERP) is also required for limestone, shell and dolomite mining projects. Environmental Resource Permitting standards are detailed in Part IV of Chapter 373, F.S., and Chapter 62-330, F.A.C. For mining activities that involve dredging or filling in state-assumed waters, a State 404 (dredge and fill) permit would

## Crucible steel
Methods of crucible steel production. Iron alloys are most broadly divided by their carbon content: cast iron has 2-4% carbon impurities; wrought iron oxidizes away most of its carbon, to less than 0.1%. The much more valuable steel has a delicately intermediate carbon fraction, and its material properties range according to the carbon percentage: high carbon steel is stronger but more
