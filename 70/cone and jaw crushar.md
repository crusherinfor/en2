## Jaw Crusher VS Cone Crusher | Advantages and Disadvantages
Also is the most mainstream crusher type. Jaw crusher is usually used as a primary crusher and second-class crusher. Cone crusher is usually used as secondary crusher or three-stage crusher machine. Jaw crusher and cone crusher are usually arranged on the stone crusher plant in two stages. Jaw crusher breaks the rock to 10 ~ 30 cm size.

## Comparison between Cone Crusher and Jaw Crusher - Virily
A jaw crusher is able to crush a material in the range of 125 mm to 1500 mm. A cone crusher is used for secondary crushing. The input to the cone crusher is much smaller and fragmented than that in the jaw crusher. The granularity of the materials that are crushed in the cone crushers is about 35mm to 350 mm.

## What is the Difference Between a Jaw Crusher and a Cone Crusher?
The price of the cone crusher is much more expensive and its capacity is stronger than a jaw crusher of the same gape. For example, if your material is 250mm, you want better processing capacity with an adequate budget, you'd better choose the cone crusher because its capacity can be 85-170 t/h, while jaw crusher only 16-105 t/h.

## Jaw Crusher Working Principle - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
A jaw crusher size is obtained by looking at its feed opening (gape) and length. As an example, a monster 7959 of 79″ x 59″ (2m x 1.5m) will have its fixed jaws 79″ apart where the feed enters on a 59″ wide set of liner plates. The factors list below will enhance crusher capacity and performance: 1. Proper selection of the jaws.

## Cone And Jaw Crushar
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing stations.

## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel. Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point. As the wedge or eccentric rotates to cause the compression within the chamber, the

For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

Jaw Crushers are sized by the top opening of the crushing chamber. For example, a 32 x 54 Jaw Crusher measures 32" from jaw die to jaw die at the top opening or gape opening and 54" across the width of the two jaw dies. The narrower bottom opening of the crushing chamber is used to size the discharge material.

Jaw crushers are typically used for primary crushing; taking your biggest feed material and crushing it to a more manageable size. Although jaw crushers can be used in a variety of processes, they thrive in aggregate. The limitation of a jaw crusher is the closed side setting, they cannot crush as small as the other crushers.

Apr 24, 2020. A cone crusher is one of many different types of crushers, like impact crushers, jaw crushers, and hammermills, that is used to process and reduce material like aggregates and construction and demolition waste. The cone crusher distinguishes itself from these other crushers by how it operates in processing material.
