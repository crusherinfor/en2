The answer to this is no and yes. We believe you should be hand sanding edges if you do not have an interface pad or if the gel coat is getting thin. To get the best results, we recommend machine sanding with a 6 inch, 8mm orbital polisher/sander with an interface pad. Set the machine on no higher than two to reduce the possibility of pigtails.
