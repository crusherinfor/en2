## Concentration of Ore - Biology Reader
The ore concentration is defined as the chemical process of eliminating impurities like sand, rocks, silt, grit etc. from the ore to extract the metals. In simple words, the concentration of ore is the method of separating ore from the gangue, as the gangue or matrix particles are the valueless substances that are of no use.

## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
Concentration refers to the methods of producing ore fractions richer in iron and lower in silica than the original material. Most processes rely on density differences to separate light minerals from heavier ones, so the ore is crushed and ground to release the ore minerals from the gangue.

## Low grade Iron Ore Beneficiation and the Process of Jigging
Jigging process. Jigging process is an ore concentration process which is carried out in any fluid whose effectiveness depends on differences in the density of the granular mineral particles. It consists of separation of the particles into layers of different specific gravities followed by the removal of the separated layers.

Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening.  The concentrate collected from the middlings and tails after spiral gravity separation has a lower iron concentration (magnetite) so it must be further concentrated to achieve the customer's 65% Fe concentration. It is immediately directed to a magnetic separator circuit.

There are numerous methods of concentration and the methods are chosen based on the properties of the ore. Hydraulic Washing: This method concentrates the ore by passing it through an upward stream of water whereby all the lighter particles of gangue are separated from the heavier metal ore. This is a type of gravity separation. Magnetic
