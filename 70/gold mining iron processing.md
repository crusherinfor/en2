Panning. Gold panning is mainly a manual gold separation technique from other materials. Large, shallow pans are filled with gold-containing sand and gravel. The pan is submerged and shaken in water, sorting the gravel gold and other material. It quickly settles down to the bottom of the pan as gold is much denser than rock.

At current gold prices this is worth about US$600. Both smelter treatment charges and oxidation or bio-leach costs are at least $200/t of concentrate and payables/recovery in the 90% range, so a minimum GSR for effective downstream processing is around 0.5. Clearly this is a function of gold price, but in the current gold price and cost

## Hammerdown Gold Project, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada
The Hammerdown gold deposit was previously mined by Canada-based mining company Richmont Mines between 2000 and 2004. A total of 291,400t of ore was mined and milled, with 143,000oz of gold recovered at an average grade of 15.83g/t Au. Mining ceased in 2004 due to low gold prices, which made mining the remaining gold mineralisation uneconomical.

The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

After the gold ore has been removed from the earth using mining equipment, it is sent to a gold processing plant. The typical gold processing plant begins with a cone crusher, to reduce the particle size of the ore. Next, it is loaded on a conveyor belt, where an overbelt magnet removes tramp metal from the gold mining process.
