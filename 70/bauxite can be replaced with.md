## What is Bauxite? - Definition from Corrosionpedia
Bauxite is a brown (clay colored), naturally occurring tropical ore used to produce aluminum. It is a residual rock formed under years of chemical weathering. Bauxite is categorized on the basis of its intended application, for example: There are various ways to obtain aluminum, but bauxite ore is commonly used due to the richness of the ore's

## Aluminum elementbookdate
Aluminum, third on the list of most abundant elements, comprises roughly 8% of the Earth's crust, and is actually the most abundant metal in the crust. Though it is the most commonly found metal, it is always found in compound form, never in its raw state. The most commonly found compounds are potassium aluminum sulphate, and aluminium oxide.

## Bauxite: Definition, Formula, Types and Different Applications
Bauxite is a sedimentary rock, which contains relatively high levels of aluminium. It is the main source of aluminium and gallium. Bauxite appears dull in luster and is reddish-brown, white, or tan in color. The rock was discovered in 1821 by French geologist Pierre Berthier, near the village of Les Braux in Provence, southern France.

The main component of bauxite is Al 2 O 3, containing a small amount of Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, and other impurities. The main objective of bauxite beneficiation is to lower the concentration of reactive silica, and also to increase the alumina content. In addition, bauxite beneficiation can also be used for iron extraction or iron removal.

The original flora and fauna of much of the land involved in bauxite mining is restored once mining operations have ceased. For all forest areas used for bauxite mining, 80% is returned to native forests, the rest is replaced by agriculture, commercial forest, or recreational area, thereby making the area more productive for the local community.
