## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing stations.

Although the structure of the jaw crusher is different, its working principle is the same, that is, the material is crushed by the periodic reciprocating motion of the movable jaw. In the process of swinging the movable jaw to the fixed jaw around the suspension mandrel, the material between the two jaw plates will be crushed, split and bent.
