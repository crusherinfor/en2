## Cement Manufacturing Process: How the Cement is Made?
All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.

## Concrete Block Manufacturing Process. How are Blocks Made?
Manufacturing Process. Concrete blocks are made in various shapes and sizes. Still, the basic principle governing how they're made remains the same: a relatively dry mixture of cement, aggregate, and water is consolidated under pressure in a block press, after which it's left to harden and dry. Once this process is complete, the block is
