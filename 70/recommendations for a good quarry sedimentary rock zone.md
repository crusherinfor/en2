Zone B consists of sedimentary rocks (units of sands and silts) existing in between ridges of basement rocks. The depth to the basement rock in this zone is very shallow and highly variable; it ranges from less than 1 m (or exposed) to about 28 m. This is the transition zone between the basement and the sedimentary rocks.
