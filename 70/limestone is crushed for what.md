As this grade contains larger pieces, it's not suitable for shoveling and stones will need to be moved individually. Typical uses for gravel #1 include: Filling larger holes.

## Gravel vs. Limestone | Hunker
Both gravel and crushed limestone are often sold based on size. Sizing is classified as screenings, pea stones and stones . Screenings start from what's virtually sand through to 3/16 of an inch in diameter. Pea stones are what we would also consider pebbles, from 3/16 to 1/2-inch in diameter. Finally, "stones" are 1/2-inch through to 4 inches

## Limestone - Formation, Composition, Types and Uses | Earth Eclipse
Limestone, or calcium carbonate, is the common rock found throughout the world. Oldest and perhaps slightly overlooked, limestone is very much part of our everyday life.  This also helps release soil minerals, such as phosphates, and making them readily available for plants. The crushed stone, called agricultural lime, is added to the soil

Description. Crushed stone is used as aggregate in construction material uses. The most common types of rock processed into crushed stone include limestone, dolomite, granite, and traprock. Smaller amounts of marble, slate, sandstone, quartzite, and volcanic cinder are also used as construction aggregates.
