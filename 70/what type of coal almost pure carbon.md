## What are the different types of coal? - American Geosciences Institute
The coal formation process involves the burial of peat, which is made of partly decayed plant materials, deep underground. The heat and pressure of burial alters the texture and increases the carbon content of the peat, which transforms it into coal, a type of sedimentary rock. This process takes millions of years. Types, or "ranks," of coal are determined by carbon content. There are four

Coking vs. Steam: Coking coal, also known as metallurgical coal, has low sulfur and phosphorus content and can withstand high heat.Coking coal is fed into ovens and subjected to oxygen-free pyrolysis, a process that heats the coal to approximately 1,100 degrees Celsius, melting it and driving off any volatile compounds and impurities to leave pure carbon.

Coke. Coking coal is converted to coke by driving off impurities to leave almost pure carbon. The coking coal is crushed and washed. It is then 'purified' or 'carbonised' in a series of coke ovens, known as batteries, where the coking coal is heated to ºC in the absence of oxygen for 12-36 hours.
