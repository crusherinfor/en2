Coal Mining Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. Once coal has been extracted, it can be used directly (for heating and industrial processes) or to fuel power plants for electricity. Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining.

Coal. Wyoming, the nation's leading coal producer since 1986, provides about 40% of America's coal through the top 10 producing mines located in the Powder River Basin. Most Wyoming coal is sub-bituminous, which makes it an attractive choice for power plants because it has less sulfur and burns at around 8,400 to 8,800 BTUs per pound.
