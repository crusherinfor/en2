What are tAILingS. Put simply, tailings are ground up rock minus the gold. Rocks mined from underground which contain gold are called ore. Processing involves crushing the ore into sand to liberate and recover the gold. What's left over is called tailings. Approximately 95% of the tailings are generated from gravity separation methods, which

This tailings treatment is based on a manipulation of the properties of the clay tailings with gypsum, a process that can reduce the water required to produce a barrel of bitumen by 25%. Our research work was critical to the commercialization effort because the manipulation of the clay behaviour required a change in process water chemistry.

## What are Tailings - Society for Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration
Tailings are a by-product of mining. After ore containing an economically-recoverable commodity is mined from the earth, that commodity is extracted in a processing plant or mill. After the commodity of value is extracted from the ore material, the resultant waste stream is termed "tailings". Typically, mill tailings range from sand to silt

In oil sands mining operations, tailings are a mixture of water, sand, clay and residual bitumen, and are the by-product of the extraction process used to separate the oil from sand and clay. Tailings and tailings ponds are not unique to the oil sands - they are used throughout Alberta and around the world in mining and other industrial processes.

The Mercury Problem in Artisanal Gold Mining. Mercury-based artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) causes more mercury pollution than any other human activity. 1 In this practice, mercury metal is used to extract gold from ore as a stable amalgam. The amalgam is then heated to evaporate the mercury and isolate the gold.

hydraulic mining, use of a powerful jet of water to dislodge minerals present in unconsolidated material, including mine tailings, placer deposits, alluvium, laterites (soil rich in iron oxides), and saprolites (soil rich in clay). It has also been applied to consolidated materials from sandstones through coal to hard rock.

## Reprocessing of Gold & Silver Mining Tailings with Ellicott Dredges
In 2012, Envirogold purchased one standard Ellicott 370 dredge in order to extract the tailings from the dam and pump them to their processing plant. The dredge was used to extract material at depths of up to 8m and pump them as slurry a distance between 500m and 800m and a terminal elevation of 11m. The slurry is pumped using a 10-inch HDPE pipe.
