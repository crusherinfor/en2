## Copper Smelting Chemistry Tutorial - AUS-e-TUTE
A copper ore is a mixture of copper minerals and other materials in the rock called gangue, from which it is economically viable to extract the metal. A typical copper ore contains between 0.5% and 2.0% copper. A high grade ore produces a high yield of metal. A low grade order produces a low yield of metal.

## extracted copper ore
A typical copper ore contains between 0.5% and 2.0% copper. A high grade ore produces a high yield of metal. A low grade order produces a low yield of metal. Copper can be extracted from sulfide ores (usually higher grade ores) by direct smelting. The earliest evidence of copper smelting occurs in Serbian artefacts dating from around 5000 BC.
