Abstract- Low cost concrete production by replacement of fine sand with Foundry sand is a new trend and makes effectively use of Waste foundry sand as engineering material by reducing disposal and pollution problem. Waste foundry sand are by-products which appears to possess the potential to partially replace regular sand as a fine aggregate in

## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
The percentage passing 150 microns of manufactured sand is relaxed to 20% (while that of natural sand is limited to 10%). As per design and economics, crushed sand can be used to partially or fully replace river sand from a concrete mix. The Availability of crushed sand is not a concern as it can be manufactured from rocks in any season.

##  Replacement of Coarse Aggregate by Demolished Brick Waste in Concrete
In this present work the study on replacement of coarse aggregate by demolished brick aggregate. Coarse aggregate can be defined as inert granular materials such as gravel, crushed stone and sand. Coarse aggregate is one of the essential ingredients apart of water and cement in concrete production.
