Solid waste from limestone quarrying has a variety of uses, ranging from the manufacturing of masonry blocks to cement production (Felekoglu, 2007; Turgut, 2008). In Pakistan, limestone is cheap and its transport expensive; therefore, the use of limestone quarry waste is limited. The average annual production of limestone is 9.95 tons in Pakistan.

## Limestone quarry, quarrying, cement raw materials
Quarrying. Most of the raw materials used are extracted from the earth through mining and quarrying and can be divided into the following groups: lime (calcareous), silica (siliceous), alumina (argillaceous), and iron (ferriferous). Since a form of calcium carbonate, usually limestone, is the predominant raw material, most plants are situated
