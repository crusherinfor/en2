## Cone Crusher vs. Impact Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone. For impact crusher, the high-speed rotating rotor throw stone into impact plates, stones are crushed via impact energy produced rotating rotor.

Impact vs Compression Style Rock Crushers. Compression crushers include jaw crushers, cone crushers, gyratory crushers and roll crushers. Impact crushers include vertical shaft impactors or horizontal shaft impactors. Compression crushers require much less maintenance; high impact crushers undergo more wear and tear due to the material colliding within the crusher.
