## Basic Information of Jaw Crusher Specification
Jaw crusher capacity is contingent upon the power of the engine as it is the engine that provides the energy requisite for continued crushing. Maximum feeding size is also directly related to engine power specifications, because a crusher's ability to reduce material is contingent upon the power an engine is capable of producing.

## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
A jaw crusher uses compressive force for breaking ore pieces. Compressive force is applied by two jaws ( dies ), one of the crusher jaws is stationary ( fixed jaw) whilst the other is moving ( swing jaw ). Material is fed into the top feed opening (gape) and gradually moves downwards towards the lower discharge outlet.

For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

## What Are Jaw Crushers And How Do They Work? - High Level Platform
Jaw crushers are primary crushers used in an ore processing or mining plants. The size of these jaw crushers is determined by the square or rectangular opening from the feed opening (top of the jaws). For example, the 24 X 36 jaw crusher will have an opening of 24″ X 36″. while a 56 X 56 jaw crusher will have an opening of 56″ square.

## Jaw Crusher, Jaw Crushing Plant - GEP Ecotech
Jaw Crusher. The Jaw Crusher reduces the size of stones and ores by squeezing, it is able to accept large size raw materials and is usually used for primary crushing. Typical features of a jaw crusher are its two large flywheels and the V-shaped jaws in the crushing chamber. During operation, the material enters the crushing chamber from above

## Estimate Jaw Crusher Capacity - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The capacities are based on the crusher receiving full, continuous feed of clean, dry, friable stone weighing 100 lb/cu ft. These capacity tables show several significant differences between the two common types of primary crushers. A jaw crusher has a wider range of settings—generally, a maximum of two to three times the smallest setting.
