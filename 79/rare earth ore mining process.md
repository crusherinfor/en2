## rare earth ore mining process
China has between 80 and 90 percent of the known reserves. China is also the leading processor of the ore— there are no working processing facilities in the United States. That means the one U.S entity — located in Mountain Pass, Calif. — that mines rare-earth minerals pays a 25 percent tax when it ships its ore to China for processing.

## Rare-earth element
The rare-earth elements (REE), also called the rare-earth metals or (in context) rare-earth oxides, or the lanthanides (though yttrium and scandium are usually included as rare-earths) are a set of 17 nearly-indistinguishable lustrous silvery-white soft heavy metals. Scandium and yttrium are considered rare-earth elements because they tend to occur in the same ore deposits as the lanthanides

The third stage of leaching process is to leach ion-absorbed rare earth ores in situ. The leaching agent solution is injected into the ore body to selectively leach rare earths; the leachate is collected through the specific channels at the bottom of the ore body and pumped to the plant at the surface of the land for further treatment to recover rare earths.

There are more than 200 minerals that contain REE. 7,8 The most common rare-earth minerals are monazite and bastnäsite (Figure 1a-b and Table II).Monazite exists as a group of arsenates, phosphates, and silicates, but the primary REE-bearing monazite is a complex phosphate. 5 Bastnäsite, also known as bastnaesite and bastnasite, is a fluorocarbonate.

This stems from the fact that rare earth element ores have metals that, when mixed with leaching pond chemicals, contaminate air, water, and soil.

## Rare Earth Processing Plant Opens in Colorado - National Defense Magazine
A new pilot plant that will process rare earth elements necessary for many critical U.S. military weapons systems opened in June, as part of an effort to end China's monopoly on the important resources. The pilot plant is a joint venture between USA Rare Earth and Texas Mineral Resources Corp. The two companies previously funded a project on

## Bringing it Home: The Implications of Onshoring Rare Earth Mining
Rare earth mining and processing are typically even more harsh on the environment than other hardrock mining practices.  Rare earth ore produces lower yield than other ores, meaning there is much more waste - up to 2,000 tons of toxic waste per ton of output.

## Rare Earth Elements: a Review of Production, Processing, Recycling, and 
Rare earth elements (REEs) are a group of 15 chemical elements in the periodic table, specifically the lanthanides. Two other elements, scandium and yttrium, have a similar physiochemistry to the lanthanides, are commonly found in the same mineral assemblages, and are often referred to as REEs. REEs have not been mined in the United States for about 20 years, and prior to that time, the amount
