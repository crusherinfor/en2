## Copper Purification Process - Electrolytic Copper Refining Plant
The electrorefining is at the heart of not only copper purification, but the production of sodium hydroxide and chlorine. In the electrolytic refining of copper, a thin sheet of high-purity Cu serves as the cathode. The blister copper plates are taken and used as anodes in an electrolyte bath of copper sulfate, CuSO4, and sulfuric acid H2SO4.

An analysis of energy usage in the production of refined cathode copper was made from mining ore to cathode copper. In mining copper ore the greatest energy consumers are ore hauling and blasting. Another important factor is the "recovery efficiency" of the metallurgical processes used to extract the copper. The mining and mineral concentrating energies are directly proportional to the

Electrowon copper cathodes are as pure as or purer than electrorefined cathodes from the smelting process. Thus they are well received by the market. Whereas the conventional process requires an estimated 65 MJ/kg of energy (not including scrap recycling ) the SX/EW process requires an estimated 15 MJ/kg (from heap or dump leaching) to 36 MJ/kg.

Individual cathode sheets are manufactured to different dimensions by different suppliers in the range of 0,5 m 2 to 1 m 2 and 3 to 20 mm thick, with or without 'ears'. Copper cathode is the primary raw material input for the production of copper rod for the wire and cable industry. Copper is also used in the production of brass, copper
