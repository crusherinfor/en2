## Copper pyrite: application and properties
The formula of copper pyrite is CuFeS 2. The mineral consists of 34.57% copper (by weight),30.54% of iron, and 34.9% of sulfur. During the chemical analysis, impurities of silver, gold, selenium, tellurium were detected in its composition. The compound has a tetragonal structure in which copper and iron surround the sulfur.

## Copper Chemical Formula: Properties and Oxidation State - Collegedunia
Copper pyrite is converted into ferrous sulfide(FeS) and Cuprous Sulfide (Cu 2 S) which are partially oxidized. 2CuFeS 2 + O 2 → Cu 2 S+ FeS + SO 2. Copper pyrite. 2FeS + 3O 2 → 2FeO + 2SO 2. 2CuS + 3O 2 → 2Cu 2 O + 2SO 2. Smelting; In this process the roasted ore is then mixed with coke and silica SiO2 and is introduced into a blast furnace.
