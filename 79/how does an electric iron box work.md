A heating element is the heart of any electric iron. It consists of a nichrome wire placed inside the mica sheet. The heating element inside the Electric iron. This nichrome wire heats up as current passes through it due to I2R loss. So longer the time of flow of current through it, the more is the heating of the Heating element.

The first electric iron was patented by Henry W. Seeley in 1882. His iron was hooked up to an electrical source by detachable wires. The electricity stimulated the iron's internal coils. But Seeley's iron, like many early electric irons, did not have electric cords. The irons were heated on a stand.
