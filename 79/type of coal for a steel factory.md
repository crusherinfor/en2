A reat option of coal for multi-fuel stoves. Glovoids are ovoid-shaped pieces of coal that burn for a long time with a high heat output. Phurnacite ovoids are used in cookers, multi-fuel stoves and room heaters. They have a long fire life and high heat output that is much easier to control than the heat from other types of coal.

There are four major types (or "ranks") of coal. Rank refers to steps in a slow, natural process called "coalification," during which buried plant matter changes into an ever denser, drier, more carbon-rich, and harder material. The four ranks are: Anthracite: The highest rank of coal. It is a hard, brittle, and black lustrous coal, often referred to as hard coal, containing a high
