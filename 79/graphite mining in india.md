## High-Quality Graphite in Sri Lanka that Amazes the World!
Graphite mining from Sri Lanka has a lower price in comparison to the rest of the world. Yet, it has supreme quality. The reason for this price difference happens as a result of low production costs. However, one kilogram of graphene costs about 27 lakhs (LKR 2,700,000) in Sri Lankan Rupees.

Graphite Mining. Pure graphite is a mineral form of the element carbon (element #6, symbol C). It forms as veins and disseminations in metamorphic rocks as the result of the metamorphism of organic material included in limestone deposits. It is an extremely soft mineral and it breaks into minute, flexible flakes that easily slide over one another.
