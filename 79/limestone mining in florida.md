Limestone quarries, the dark rectangular shapes just west of the urban areas, provide about half of the rock used in Florida's construction. In this part of Florida, groundwater is very near the surface. So as the rock is mined, the quarry pits fill with water. These lakes range from 30 to 50 feet deep and cover a total of about 4,900 acres.
