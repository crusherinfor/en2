## How Is Recycled Concrete Aggregate Made? - AEI Screens
Once the recycled concrete has been sourced, it can be processed. This starts with crushing. RCA is first crushed using industrial equipment. This step in the process breaks up the original structure, reducing it from larger slabs into a granulated material. After the concrete is crushed, it's then run through another impactor.
