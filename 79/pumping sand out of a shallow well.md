## How to Pump Sand out of a Shallow Well | HomeSteady
The sand is easier to remove when it floats in the water. Insert a submersible, or similar, pump into the well. Pump the water and sand until the water runs clear. You can allow the water from the well to run over the land surface if the water is clean. Repeat the surge block and pumping process to make sure the sand is gone.

A shallow well jet pump will suck air from joints that will not leak when pressure is on it. Also water can only be sucked up 31 feet vertical in a pure vacuum at sea level. As you altitude above sea level rises, the vertical distance water can be sucked up decreases. Very few jet pumps are more than 80% efficient.

Sometimes the well pump may be too big a pump for the well and draw sand or grit in from the adjoining water table. Sand can be very hard on the well pump and can rapidly wear out the pump, fill the base of the well.
