The bearing installation shafts of the rotor were compensatively ground using the 3D grinding originally developed for paper machine rolls. The operating principle of this manufacturing method is that the final geometry is achieved with an iterative process using the roundness measurement data as feedback.

## Is it worth replacing bearings in a washing machine?
Can you use a washing machine with broken bearings? Can I still use my washing machine if the bearings are gone? Yes, but not for long.  The drum's main bearing is probably faulty if the drum spins unevenly or you hear a grinding noise. However, if you hear a squeaking noise (versus squeaking) the bearing may just need to be greased.
