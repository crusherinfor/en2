The world will need iron ore for as long as the world needs steel. In 2020, we produced around 280 million tonnes of iron ore. That's enough to make the steel for more than 3,300 Sydney Harbour Bridges. We're building a new iron ore mine in Western Australia. When completed, South Flank will produce high-quality iron ore for around 25 years.

## How iron is made - material, manufacture, making, history, used 
Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes. The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 92-94% iron and 3-5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.  The process of extracting iron from ore produces great quantities of poisonous and corrosive gases. In

## How to make iron ingot from iron ore in Steel Company daneshtrading
Make iron ingots from iron ore in blast furnaces, is that the iron ore is sent to the blast furnaces along with coke and lime after it has passed the pre-baking stage and turned into lumps. In fact, kilns use coke for steel. In this operation, crude iron is extracted with cast iron, which in the next step these two materials must be separated.

## Pig Iron Manufacturing Process - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Pig Iron. At the beginning of the use of the electric furnace, for the manufacture of calcium carbide and ferro-alloys, experimental work was conducted in it upon the production of steel from iron ore. For many years steel and wrought iron have been produced directly from ore on a small scale in the forge, crucible, and reverberatory furnaces
