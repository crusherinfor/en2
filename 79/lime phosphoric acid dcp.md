## Calcium carbonate uses in poultry feed
Calcium Carbonate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula CaCO3 and is a type of salt. It consists of three (3) chemical elements: calcium, carbon and oxygen.It is a common ingredient of rocks in (almost) all parts of the world, as well as a main ingredient of exoskeleton sea (mostly) organisms, such as snails, sponges and corals.

The major acid in lemon-lime flavored soft drinks is citric acid (as opposed to many other sodas which have additional phosphoric acid). Citric acid (H 3 C 6 H 5 O 7) is triprotic, but the K a values of each of the protons are very similar. This results in a titration with only one clear equivalence point which occurs after the neutralization of the third (final) proton.

Dicalcium phosphate is the calcium phosphate with the formula CaHPO4 and its dihydrate. The "di" prefix in the common name arises because the formation of the HPO42- anion involves the removal of two protons from phosphoric acid, H3PO4. It is also known as dibasic calcium phosphate or calcium monohydrogen phosphate.

## Calcium carbonate uses in poultry feedre.shop
Increasingly livestock and poultry farmers are using monocalcium phosphate (MCP) due to its higher phosphorus content. The MCP production process takes DCP to the next level. By reacting the DCP with purified feed grade phosphoric acid MDCP (a complex of mono- and dicalcium phosphate) the products phosphorous content is further improved.
