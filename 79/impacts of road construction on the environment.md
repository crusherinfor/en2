## What are the environmental impacts of road construction?
Sep 29, 2020They can also cause adverse impacts on natural water resources and discharge areas. The three most damaging effects of road construction and management are noise, dust and vibrations. How does the construction industry affect the environment? Compared to road construction, the building construction industry spewed off lower pollutant emissions.

## The environmental and social impacts of roads in southeast Asia
The expansion of road networks shows no signs of abating, especially in developing countries where economic growth is rapid and opportunities for natural resource exploitation are plentiful. When a road is built, there will invariably be environmental and social impacts. Among tropical regions, however, these impacts are probably least studied in Southeast Asia.

## What Are The Impacts Of Infrastructural Developments On The Environment 
The construction of roads and railways necessitates the cutting down and clearing of vegetation over long distances. Thus, the green cover in such areas is lost. Deforestation has a wide range of environmental impacts such as habitat loss and soil erosion among others. Roads and railways affect the migration of wild animals.
