## Extracting Iron from Iron Ore in a Blast Furnace - StudyMode
The Iron is extracted from the ore that contains the most amount of iron. The iron is extracted from its oxide ore called Hematite. Many things are produced in the extracting or iron from iron ore in a blast furnace. The iron ore is reacted with carbon and oxygen in the furnace to produce carbon dioxide and iron metal.

## Iron Extraction and Purification / Steel | ChemKey
Mild steel is iron containing up to about 0.25% of carbon. The presence of the carbon makes the steel stronger and harder than pure iron. The higher the percentage of carbon, the harder the steel becomes. Mild steel is used for lots of things - nails, wire, car bodies, ship building, girders and bridges amongst others.

When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

The basic extraction of metals from ores has the following steps. Grinding and Crushing. The bigger chunks of the ore extracted are crushed and ground in ball mills and crushers. It helps to increase the surface area of the chunks for better chemical actions later. In technical terms, it is called pulverisation.
