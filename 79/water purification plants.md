## Electro deionization technology EDI in a Water Treatment Plant
To control the process through Electro Deionization Technology (EDI), PLCs are used in the water treatment plant. The flow of the inlet water is controlled using the ON-OFF valves or the control valves. Pumps are used to inject the water into the water treatment plant. So, the functioning of the pumps is also controlled using the PLC logic.
