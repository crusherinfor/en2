## Garden Guides | Gypsum Vs. Lime for Soil
Types of Lime. Two kinds of lime, CaO, are ordinarily used to raise the pH of soil. Calcitic limestone is largely calcium carbonate, CaCO2. Dolomitic limestone, made from rocks containing magnesium carbonates and calcium, must be at least 6 percent magnesium. Since ground limestone is dusty and difficult to spread, lime is usually marketed in

As this occurs, the size of the dolomite crystals in the rock increases, and the rock develops a distinctly crystalline appearance. Where is dolomite found in the sedimentary basin? Dolomite is found in sedimentary basins worldwide. It is thought to form by the postdepositional alteration of lime mud and limestone by magnesium-rich groundwater.

Most plants grow best at a pH of 6.0 to 7.4 - neutral. If the soil is lower than 5.9, dolomite lime can be used to elevate the pH so that it is a bit more alkaline and amenable to healthy plant growth. While neutral soil is preferred by most plants, soil pH occasionally can veer more into the acidic or more alkaline territory.
