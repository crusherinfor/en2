## Health effects of uranium: new research findings - PubMed
Uranium mining can contaminate air, water, and soil. The chemical toxicity of the metal constitutes the primary environmental health hazard, with the radioactivity of uranium a secondary concern. The update of the toxicologic evidence on uranium adds to the established findings regarding nephrotoxicity, genotoxicity, and developmental defects.

## How does mining affect animals? | Socratic
Explanation: Mining tends to have its biggest impact to animals in destroying animals ecological habitats. However, if the mine is reclaimed at the end of its life, these habitats can be restored through proper reclamation. Most mines last somewhere between 20-100 years. Mines that are not closely regulated can also produce a lot of local air

Uranium Mining Exposure Mechanisms and Environmental Costs. Until the 1970s, uranium was primarily acquired through open-air pits. Mining companies would extract rocks containing uranium from the ground and then crush them into a powdered dust. Thereafter, a liquid solution separated the uranium from the other matter in the rock.

Depending on where the ore is located, copper mining can severely damage the environment through deforestation. To pursue an open-pit mining operation, copper miners must remove trees and dig a pit to access it. Open-pit mines are massive. They can be nearly a mile in diameter and several thousand feet deep.
