## Where Is Graphite Found In The Us - Realonomics
The US currently produces no graphite and many are wondering if graphite mining in the US will happen. Which US state has the most graphite? Graphite of various grades has been produced intermittently in the United States since 1644. The principal domestic deposits of flake graphite are in Texas Alabama Pennsylvania and New York.

## Graphite deposits in the United States | U.S. Geological Survey
Graphite occurs in the U.S. as disseminated flake graphite deposits and as graphite veins. Globally, most currently mined flake graphite deposits contain at least 8 to 12 percent graphitic carbon in deposits larger than 0.5 million metric tons (Robinson and others, 2017). In comparison, the Graphite Creek deposit in Alaska contains a measured

Canadian Graphite Mining Stocks. Graphite is unique in many respects compared to other metals. To understand the potential of graphite in mines and deposits and prices, it is necessary to understand several essential things. To get reasonable market prices, a mining company must bring its graphite up to 94% to 97% carbon levels.

Graphite facts. Graphite is a non-metallic mineral that has properties similar to metals, such as a good ability to conduct heat and electricity. Graphite occurs naturally or can be produced synthetically. Purified natural graphite has higher crystalline structure and offers better electrical and thermal conductivity than synthetic material.
