Spent foundry sand was obtained from the Chrysler, Inc. foundry located in Indianapolis, Indiana. The foundry sand was iron green sand with phenolic urethane cold box binder. It was mixed with yard waste compost (made at Purdue), silty-clay, according to the following percentages (60% compost, 25% soil, and 15% spent foundry sand).

## How to Improve Clay Soil With Compost the Right Way
A general rule of thumb is to add 1 to 3 inches of compost tilled into the clay soil (source). The compost should be worked down into the top 10 to 12 inches, where the roots grow. Adding compost to your clay soil will help distribute those nutrients to your plants and improve digging in your garden. After adding in your compost, you won't

In contrast, the DHA in soil amended with an aluminum green sand was 2.1 times higher (all blending ratios), on average, at week 4 and 1.4 times greater (30% and 50% treatments only) than the controls by week 12. In core sand-amended soil, the DHA results were similar to soils amended with aluminum and iron green sands.

Glacier View likes to add about 20% more horse manure compost to our mixture. Clay can be amended with sand to provide drainage, but a mixture of 80% sand to clay is required or else adobe will be created (a concrete like material used in adobe home construction). This is usually not feasible and is generally excluded as a viable option.

## blending sand with clay soils
Jul 24, 2018 In many types of clay, the sand will actually just accumulate at the top of the soil layer and form a very hard, rock-like surface. If you are wanting to improve drainage and growth sustainability on your clay soil, what you should do is double pass core aerate and then spread an 80/20 or 60/40 compost/sand blend over the lawn.

Sep 9, 2022The organic matter needs to be mixed into the top 6 to 12 inches of soil. Digging it in and mixing it with a shovel is a great way to do this, as it moves a lot of earth without pulverizing the soil particles the way tilling can. However, if digging is just too hard on your back, using a tiller is a fine method.

Adding sand to clay soils has its benefits. Due to its fine texture, mixing with sand improves the blending. However, it is not easy as it sounds to achieve an aerated and loose texture. Clay requires a lot of sand to loosen up. To achieve the best results, you need approximately 4 inches of well-aerated sand that goes on 6 inches of clay topsoil.
