## Beneficiation
Beneficiation. In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step

## The Influence of Tax Legislation in Promoting Downstream Beneficiation 
Abstract. Downstream beneficiation in the South African mining industry is promoted in the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act. This research evaluated the influence of existing tax and royalty legislation in promoting downstream beneficiation, and the economic decisions of mining companies to respond to the benefits provided for in the legislation.

## Why do we need beneficiation? Explained by FAQ Blog
How does beneficiation work? In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product (ore concentrate) and a waste stream (tailings).

In 2017, mining contributed R334.7 billion or 8 percent to gross domestic product from R306.2 billion in 2016 an increase of R28.4 billion. The increase in production and value addition by mining can be attributed to the recovery in prices of commodities. The improved commodity prices brought the mining industry back into profitability.

4.1.1 Iron Ore Mining There are two basic methods of mining iron ore. These are: • Surface mining or open-pit mining • Underground or shaft mining To be competitive, iron mining must be done on a very large scale. Surface mining is the preferred choice, although there are exceptions. Small, low-capacity mines have rapidly disappeared.
