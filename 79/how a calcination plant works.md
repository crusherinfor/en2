## Pre-calciner in Cement Manufacturing Process
While the raw material drying capacity of the grinding plant (using kiln exit gas) decreases with the increase in kiln gas bypass volume.  Higher rate of calcination is accomplished by introducing additional heat into the precalciner Thus, about 40 - 60 % of the total heat required is introduced into the precalciner reducing the heat

Calcination in air and reduction with hydrogen were found to have a profound influence on Pd/CNFs property (Table 2).After calcination in air at 250°C for 2 h, the catalytic activity decreased evidently when using H 2 PdCl 4 as the precursor, but change only slightly when using Pd(NH 3) 4 Cl 2.However, when first calcinated and then reduced with a Ha/Ar gas stream at 300°C for 1.5 h, both

This ensures that the catalyst and substrate are well bonded and also hardens the catalyst so it can hold up under duty. In addition, calcination also assists in: ¹. Removing impurities that could otherwise poison the catalyst. Aiding in control of surface density. Finalizing the surface area of the support structure.
