## Natural gas and the environment - U.S. Energy Information 
Natural gas is a relatively clean burning fossil fuel. Burning natural gas for energy results in fewer emissions of nearly all types of air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO 2) than burning coal or petroleum products to produce an equal amount of energy. About 117 pounds of CO 2 are produced per million British thermal units (MMBtu) equivalent

However, a natural gas well doesn't work in the same way at all. A water well is created by drilling a hole in the ground and letting it fill with water. A natural gas well needs to drill further, into the underground rock itself. That means these wells are deeper and therefore more dangerous to create. How A Natural Gas Well Is Created
