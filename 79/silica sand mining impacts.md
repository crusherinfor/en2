## W. Central Wisconsin Landscape & Silica Sand Mining Effects
Silica sand is a highly sought after proppant for this purpose and often found in Wisconsin and Michigan. At the present time here in Ohio our Utica laterals are averaging 4,300-5,000 tons of silica sand or "proppant" with demand increasing by 85+ tons per lateral per quarter. Wisconsin's 125+ silica sand mines and processing facilities

A mined silica sand site. Figure 4. The ravenous topography resulted from large scale open cast mining. sand falls by gravity to the bottom. After washing, the sand is then sent to a surge pile where water adhering to the sand particles infiltrates back into the ground. From the surge pile the sand is sent to the dryer and screening.

Sand is the most mined substance in the world, with a significant amount of illegal mining activity from "sand mafias". Image credit: Wikimedia Commons. Sand is the single most mined commodity, eclipsing minerals and metals by a colossal margin. Around 85% of the material we pull up from the earth is sand, gravel or other aggregate materials.

This information focuses on respirable crystalline silica, which is the more hazardous form. Silica is a major constituent of many types of sand. It is also a component of concrete and some bricks and rocks (eg granite, slate, sandstone). As such, this hazard can be found in industries such as construction, masonry, mining and foundries.

## Is Silica Bad for the Environment? - Our Endangered World
Jan 28, 2022Silica dioxide or most commonly known as silica. Is commonly found in nature in most parts of the world. It is solid at a normal temperature. The silica usually resides in soil, but sometimes it also can be found on plants or even inside humans' bodies. The human body contains around 2-5 g of silica while some adults may have more than that but have the same health benefit.
