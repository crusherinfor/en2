## What Is Expanded Shale: Learn About Expanded Shale Uses In The Garden
Expanded shale is used by orchid and bonsai enthusiasts to create lightweight, aerating, water retentive potting soils. It can be used with other containerized plants as well. Put a third of the shale in the bottom of the pot and then mix the shale with potting soil 50-50 for the rest of the container. To lighten heavy clay soil, lay a 3-inch

When clay, shale or slate is crushed and then exposed to high heat (3,600 0F) and cooked for a period of time, they expand like popcorn into a very hard rock that is very porous and light weight. There are many names used for these products such as Haydite, Buildex, Expanded shale, etc. depending on the source material and where you live.
