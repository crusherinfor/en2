The BTM is a low-speed mill that primarily grinds coal by impact and attrition. The VRM is a medium- speed mill that grinds coal by compression and, because of the low coal inventory in the mill and flat grinding surfaces, develops shearing action as well. For both mills a constant centrifugal force is maintained. The speed
