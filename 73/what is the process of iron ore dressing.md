Extraction of Iron from its ores, Iron dressing, Reduction  · Extraction of Iron from its ores. Extraction of iron or its metallurgy is the process of obtaining this metal in a form where it can be put to practical use, and this process of extraction consists of three stages: Ore dressing, Reduction of ores and Iron production.

## Direct reduced iron process - tec-science
In contrast to the blast furnace process, the direct-reduced iron process operates at temperatures of up to 1000 °C. The iron ores are therefore not melted! This also applies to the gangue contained in the ore, which is why the iron ores used must be relatively low in gangue from the outset. The reduction gases only dissolve oxygen from the

Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to go through a dressing process before it can be sent to smelting for utilization. After the mined ore goes through the processes of crushing and grinding, magnetic separation, flotation and gravity separation, the high-grade concentrate is obtained.At present, the iron ore resources are decreasing day by day.

We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing.

Ore processing (or ore dressing) is the separation of iron ore from gangue in order to optimize the blast furnace process! In principle, the undesirable gangue can never be completely separated from the iron ores during ore dressing. This means that a certain amount of unwanted elements always enters the blast furnace process.
