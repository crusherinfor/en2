## Ore Ore, gangue, ore minerals, gangue minerals, Ore deposits 
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

## Two-Stage Oxidative Leaching of Low-Grade Copper-Zinc Sulfide 
A high zinc content in copper concentrates, obtained from polymetallic ores, reduces copper extraction during pyrometallurgical processes, increasing slag viscosity [8,12]. In addition, one of the main problems of copper production is the formation of flotation tailings and slags during ore dressing and smelting/converting.

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## flotation of lead and zinc from lead zinc pyrite ore pdf
The established lead-zinc ore flotation processing scheme is to add zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) to the grind to control metal ion activation (sphalerite depression) Often metabisulphide or other sulphidation chemicals are added with the zinc sulphate for iron sulphide mineral depressionflotation of lead and zinc from lead zinc pyrite ore pdf flotation of lead and zinc from lead zinc pyrite ore pdf
