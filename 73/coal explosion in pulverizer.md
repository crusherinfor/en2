## Boiler explosionentrum-sec-unity
Steam Explosions . There are two major types of boiler explosions : those that occur due to pressure, and those that occur due to a fuel leak. In pressure explosions, the rupture is caused by the build-up of high-pressure steam. The pressure of this steam eventually overloads the boiler and causes it to explode, often with violent force.
