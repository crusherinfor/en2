The first large-scale mine was sunk in 1852. Industrial-scale smelting began in South Africa in the 1850s or 1860s when copper was produced by the O'okiep Copper Company in cupola furnaces, and the partially smelted copper matte was exported to South Wales for further refining. The O'okiep Copper Company was

Beginning in the late 1600s, copper smelting became a major industry in Great Britain. Copper ore from Cornwall and other areas and coal deposits throughout the country fueled the smelting of copper. An abundance of coal in Swansea, Wales made this coastal town a prime location for Britain's copper smelting activities beginning in early 1700s.

## Copper in Africa
Copper is one of the world's most important industrial minerals, and Africa is an important world producer. While output is traditionally dominated by Zambia, South Africa and Katanga Province in the south of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, many African nations contribute to copper production, and many African nations have undeveloped ore resources.

## Copper Electrolytic Plant - Wire Stripper Machine and Cable Granulator 
The refining anodes taken out from the refining furnace is changed into electrolytic copper with purity of 99.99% through an electrolysis process: During electrolysis, copper (II) ions leave the impure copper anode and since they are positive, migrating to the negative cathode. From time to time, the pure copper is scraped off the cathode.

A few oppositional voices had argued that ironworking has been 'invented independently in sub-Saharan Africa (Andah 1979; Schmidt and Avery 1983)' (Childs et al. 2005, 278). It might be possible as the process had originated from the smelting
