## Coal-Fired Power - Analysis - IEA
Of the 140 coal-fired power plants in operation, more than two-thirds (representing ~50% of installed coal capacity) will be retired. Around 5 GW of new ultra-supercritical and integrated gasification combined-cycle plants will replace some of the retired capacity. In Germany, ~EUR 4.35 billion will be awarded to lignite power plant companies

Thermal power station. Most thermal stations use coal as the main fuel. Raw coal is transported from coal mines to a power station site by trucks, barges, bulk cargo ships, or railway cars. Generally, when shipped by railway, the coal cars are sent as a full train of cars. The coal received at site may be of different sizes.
