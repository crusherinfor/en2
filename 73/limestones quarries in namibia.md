## How Limestone is Formed
Mining can take place under hundreds of miles and many areas of quarry miles. Many different quarries will put together several different products and some crushed rocks that are impure can be used for road items. Using Limestone Limestone has a lot of different industrial uses and can be mined and processed for those reasons as a raw material.
