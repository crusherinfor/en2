Mining Limestone. Limestone deposits can be huge and cover hundreds of square miles. It's usually uniform in quality and thickness, but limestone quarries can be long-lived because of the abundance.  Limestone is a beautiful, natural material that shows up in homes often as well. It is commonly used in tiles for flooring, walls, or even

The Limestone Quarry located off Main Street and Metcalf Drive is a lovely 4 acres. In the 1940s, as they were mining for limestone, workers hit a spring. Local legend held that workers were barely able to get out before the area flooded, and they left their equipment behind. However, in 2013, three scuba divers were permitted to explore the

##  Limestone Quarrying and Processing: A Life-Cycle Inventory
Limestone can also be chemical in origin as is the case with travertine. Chemical limestone forms when calcium and carbonate ions suspended in water chemically bond and precipitate from their aquatic sources. Because of its high calcium content, limestone is usually light in color, although many variations exist.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
