This allowed Dibbell to found the Carolina Minerals Company of Penland. By 1917, North Carolina was the nation's top feldspar producer. Until about 1949, most of the mining work, especially extracting the mineral from ore, was done by hand. Ira Thomas, a ninth-generation miner, started tagging along with his father when he was just 6 years old.
