## Prehistoric and Ancient Native American Tools and Technology in Iowa
Hard hammers are typically made of igneous or metamorphic rocks such as granite, quartz, basalt, or gneiss.  Archaic people developed a new way of making tools by slowly pecking and grinding a rock into the shape they desired. A common Archaic ground stone tool is the grooved axe. The tapered bit was used to chop or split wood.

## Quartz Mineral | Photos, Uses, Properties, Pictures - Geology
Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen, with a chemical composition of SiO 2. It is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and is resistant to both chemical and physical weathering. When rocks weather away, the residual material usually contains quartz. This is why the sand at most of the world's beaches is quartz.

## Quartzite stone authenticity and glass testing to check quality
Quartzite is a metamorphic rock and formed from pure quartz sandstone through heating and pressure. Pure quartzite stone occurs in grey to white tones, but due to varying amounts of iron oxides (Fe 2 O 3), it is also found in different shades of pink and red.Apart from Fe 2 O 3, other mineral impurities can impart other colors to quartzite, such as green, blue, orange and yellow.

Quartzite is a metamorphic rock made from quartz sandstone, a sedimentary rock predominantly composed of the silicate mineral quartz. The chemical composite of the quartz minerals is silicon dioxide, written SiO2. The metamorphic forces of heat and pressure force the quartz minerals to bind together and crystallize into a strong matrix.

## Quartzite: Metamorphic Rock - Pictures, Definition & More - Geology
What is Quartzite? Quartzite is a nonfoliated metamorphic rock composed almost entirely of quartz.It forms when a quartz-rich sandstone is altered by the heat, pressure, and chemical activity of metamorphism.. Metamorphism recrystallizes the sand grains and the silica cement that binds them together. The result is a network of interlocking quartz grains of incredible strength.
