## How Is Recycled Concrete Aggregate Made? | Aggregates Equipment, Inc.
Once the recycled concrete has been sourced, it can be processed. This starts with crushing. RCA is first crushed using industrial equipment. This step in the process breaks up the original structure, reducing it from larger slabs into a granulated material. After the concrete is crushed, it's then run through another impactor.

## recycled concrete Topic - American Concrete Institute
The reason for recycling is the reduction of waste in order to protect nature against pollution, the increasing shortage of suitable dumping grounds, and to save energy and natural resources. Concrete debris is typically reclaimed as recycled aggregate (RCA). By recycling concrete, valuable landfill space and natural resources are preserved.

## Recycled Aggregates from Construction Demolition Wastes -Types 
The construction and demolition waste aggregates are classified by BS 8500 (2002). The code classifies this into two types as: The concrete aggregate that contains 95% of crushed concrete is called as recycled concrete aggregates. And if the aggregate used in the concrete is 100% crushed, it is called as recycled aggregates.

## Recycling and Reusing Concrete - NY Engineers
Reusing concrete can help reduce construction costs, since it saves the cost of transporting concrete to the landfill, which is around $0.25/ton/mile. Recycling also eliminates disposal costs, while reducing the environmental impact of the project. Concrete that is recycled will not end up in landfills and can also replace raw materials.
