## How Is Iron Ore Mined - Realonomics
What is iron mining? Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries.

The method does not use water to process iron ore, instead it transforms mining tailings - with low iron content and no commercial value - into high iron content and low contaminants, making it economically viable. As iron ore must be composed of grades of at least 58 per cent, mining companies stack the lower grade material on tailings dumps.
