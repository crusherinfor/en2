## Chemical and Mineralogical Characterization of Itakpe Iron Ore Mine 
Samples of Itakpe Iron Ore waste dump (tailings) were collected using random sampling method from different locations at the tailings dump sites of National Iron Ore Mining Company (NIOMCO) in Itakpe, Kogi State, Nigeria and properly homogenized to give the head sample. The head sample was chemically analyzed using Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry (ED-XRFS).

The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron. Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel. Steel is used to make automobiles, locomotives, ships, beams used in buildings, furniture, paper clips, tools, reinforcing rods for concrete, bicycles, and thousands of other items. It is the most-used metal by both tonnage and purpose.

## Characteristics Of Itakpe Iron Ore
Chemical Analysis Of Itakpe Iron Ore Tailings. The analysis of the itakpe iron ore in nigeria would determine whether the associated metals are commercially feasible for secondary recovery. due to these afore mentioned problems, the research was carried out using edx - xrf and xrd, analyzing five different samples which include coarse iron ore

## Utilization of iron tailings as aggregates in paving asphalt mixture: A 
Iron tailings is a by-product of iron ore with the production rate of 1:2.5 to 1:3, which is usually dependent on mining condition (Ma et al., 2016). It was reported that its total amount accounted for about 39% among all tailings including various metallic and non-metallic tailings ( Jiang et al., 2022 ).
