## Anchoring Fragrances in Cold Process Soap
If you have the time, I'd recommend making your kaolin clay slurry at least 24 hours in advance of making your batch of soap. This gives the clay plenty of time to soak up as much fragrance oil as possible. To make a kaolin clay slurry, simply add the clay directly to the fragrance oil, then blend it in really well with a mini mixer.

## Region's kaolin history is nearly forgotten
Kaolin, or "China clay," is an essential ingredient in the manufacture of fine china and porcelain. It has also been widely used in the making of paper, rubber, paint, and heat-resistant products. Fine chinaware is, of course, associated with the nation that first refined the process, and the name kaolin arises from the Chinese for Kau-ling
