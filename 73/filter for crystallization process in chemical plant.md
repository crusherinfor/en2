Crystallization Definition. Crystallization is a natural process which occurs as materials solidify from a liquid, or as they precipitate out of a liquid or gas. This can be caused by a physical change, such as a temperature change, or a chemical change such as acidity. Crystallization is a process directed by the size and shapes of the

The crystallization process consists of two major events: Nucleation - Molecules gather together in clusters in a defined manner. Clusters need to be stable under current experimental conditions to reach the "critical cluster size" or they will redissolve. It is this point in the crystallization process that defines the crystal structure.

Nucleation: The first stage or step in the process of crystallization is nucleation. Among the atoms, the first to form a crystal becomes the center of the nucleation and more atoms are formed around that nucleus.
