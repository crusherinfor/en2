## Types of rock drillinguvenirsgourmands.fr
Turn the Dremel on and begin drilling by placing the bit at a 45-degree angle from the surface. This angle will begin to dig into the rock while limiting the possibility of slipping during use. Once the hole has begun, adjust the angle of the bit by slowly bringing it to a 90-degree angle from the surface of the rock .
