## mineral processing | metallurgy | Britannica
mineral processing, art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock, or gangue. It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy. The primary operations are comminution and concentration, but there are other important operations

Mineral processing, mineral beneficiation, or upgradation involves handling three primary types of ROM material, which have been blasted, fragmented, and brought out from an in situ position. These materials can be used directly or by simple or complex processing and even by applying extractive metallurgy like hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical methods.
