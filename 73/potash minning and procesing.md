## Potash and Solution Mining | YanCoal
Yancoal Canada - Southey Potash Project. When the potash to be extracted is at a depth of 1000 m or deeper and/or the potash it is located in sedimentary rock then solution mining provides a cost effective, efficient and safe way to extract the resource. Added benefits of solution mining include: lower up-front capital cost, no underground
