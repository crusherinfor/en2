## Gypsum | Common Minerals
Gypsum is a very soft mineral that is easily identified by its hardness, cleavage, and solubility in water. Typically clear to white, gypsum may be colored reddish to brown or yellow if impurities are present. Most gypsum occurs in its massive form, as layers of rock that often intercalate layers of shale, limestone, or dolostone.

Gypsum is an evaporite mineral like salt and comes from such drying up of large bodies of water, or from the evaporation of sea water in mud flats at the edge of the sea. In later times the gypsum was covered by sand or mud and buried beneath the land surface while dinosaurs and other large reptiles walked on top of it.
