Jun 19, 2016· A gold dredge is a placer mining machine that extracts gold from sand, gravel, and dirt using water and mechanical methods. The original gold dredges were large, multi-story machines built in the first half of the 1900s.  Panning for gold was also known as "placer mining."

## Gold Mining during the Early Roman Empire
Mining Technology. The technology used to extract metal from ore in the Roman Empire was quite advanced at the time. The Romans were already smelting ore, a technology that continues to be used even today. At its basic form, smelting is simply heating the ore to create a molten liquid that separates the metal from the rest of the ore.

## What Were Some of the Tools That Were Used in the Gold Mines?
5 Pans. Panning for gold was also known as "placer mining." Early miners sat by riverbeds, scooping wet soil into shallow metal pans. They swirled the pans, washing away the dirt to hopefully discover particles of gold. Though more complex equipment was eventually invented, pans were still a useful tool to distinguish gold from dirt.

## Early Gold Mining Techniques | Museum of Industry
Montague, c. 1986 by Joseph Purcell. MOI: I95.86.1. The earliest gold mining was done by hand, using a hammer and a pick or a gold pan. The first use of machinery in the gold rush was in the 1860s at an underground mine in Tangier. The machine, called an arrastre, used a giant stone attached to a wooden arm, moved by a horse, to crush the gold

## Gold Mining in America - Legends of America
Since the discovery of the original home of gold, the extraction of it was carried on in a more scientific manner than placer mining. There are other modes of obtaining gold, which almost became obsolete. The arrastra, for instance, was used in the early days to pulverize the ore. It was a Mexican contrivance, rude, but effective.
