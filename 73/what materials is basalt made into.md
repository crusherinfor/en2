## Basalt: Igneous Rock - Pictures, Definition, Uses & More - Geology
What is Basalt? Basalt is a dark-colored, fine-grained, igneous rock composed mainly of plagioclase and pyroxene minerals. It most commonly forms as an extrusive rock, such as a lava flow, but can also form in small intrusive bodies, such as an igneous dike or a thin sill.It has a composition similar to gabbro.The difference between basalt and gabbro is that basalt is a fine-grained rock while

## What Does Basalt Turn Into - Realonomics
How does basalt turn into a sedimentary rock? On the surface weathering and erosion break down the igneous rock into pebbles sand and mud creating sediment which accumulates in basins on the Earth's surface. As successive layers of sediment settle on top of one another the sediment near the bottom is compressed hardens and forms sedimentary rock.

1. River pebble, basalt, granite, limestone, bluestone, iron ore, etc. These are ideal green building materials with a hard texture. They can be used as raw materials for sand and gravel production lines. Sand made of basalt mixed with retarded concrete reduces the weight of the concrete and provides thermal and acoustic insulation.

The weird and wonderful properties of basalt fibre. The not-quite microscopic strands of basalt fibre are created by taking basalt, a common volcanic rock, heating it to 1,500°C, and spinning the melted rock through a fine nozzle. The resulting material is commonly then either woven into a heat-resistant fabric, or used to reinforce materials.
