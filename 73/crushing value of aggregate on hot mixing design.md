## Aggregate Crushing Value - CivilArc
The aggregate crushing value provides a subjective measure of the resistance of the aggregate crushing in the pressure of the progressively smeared compressive load. When the aggregate crushing value is 30 or greater the outcome can be irregular and in those kind of circumstances the ten percent fines value has to be assessed in its place.

##  Methods for determination of aggregate crushing value (ACV) (BS 
Scope: This Part of BS 812 describes a method for the determination of the aggregate crushing value (ACV) which gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. The method is applicable to aggregates passing a 14.0 mm test sieve and retained on a 10.0 mm test sieve.

Crushing Value of Aggregate vlab. The crushing value of aggregates is rather insensitive to variation in strength of weaker aggregates. For this reason, a simple test known as 10 percent fine value is introduced. When the aggregates crushing value become 30% or higher, the results are likely to be inaccurate.
