The compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve. In a compression test, there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke's law.Hence, for this region, =, where, this time, E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression.In this region, the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.
