## Aluminium Smelting Process Flow Chart - KMC Aluminium
The electrolysis process. In the electrolytic reduction process of smelting, the next step is where Carbon anodes are inserted in the top of the bath and an electric current passes through the anodes. The oxygen atoms separate from the alumina and combine with the carbon anode, leaving the remaining molten aluminum at the bottom of the pot.

Production of aluminum from its ores at aluminum smelters results in carbon dioxide CO2, carbon monoxide CO, sulfur dioxide SO2, and hydrogen fluoride HF gas emissions to the atmosphere.  In addition, several fluoride compounds may be produced during the aluminum production process . These compounds include carbon tetrafluoride CF4.

Aluminium smelting is the process of extracting aluminium from its oxide, alumina, generally by the Hall-Héroult process.  An aluminium smelter consists of a large number of cells (pots) in which the electrolysis takes place. A typical smelter contains anywhere from 300 to 720 pots, each of which produces about a ton of aluminium a day

## How to Get Aluminum from Bauxite| Reduction Process
The electrolytic reduction cell includes cryolite-based electrolyte, aluminum feeder, carbon block, and carbon lining. Aluminum smelting requires large amounts of electricity. 1 Carbon blocks are manufactured  (Na 3 AlF 6) to lower its melting point for electrolysis. Finally, the electrolytical reduction at a temperature of about 960°C

## Aluminum electrolytic color anodising
Variety of color anodizing aluminum - aluminum electrolytic coloration - a two-stage process, in which the pores of the pre anodized aluminum, located in electrolyte on the basis of a metal salt, via the electric current of the precipitated particles of metal. Most often, the inorganic salt is used tin-based, cobalt, nickel and copper.
