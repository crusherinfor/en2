## Colloidal silica: CWK
We produce colloidal dispersions of silica particles in water under the trade name Köstrosol ®. The particles are made from high-purity alkali silicate. They are spherical and generally non-crosslinked and are hydroxylated at the surface. The reactivity of our colloidal silica can be modified and changed according to their target application.
