The more copper or silver within the gold alloy the faster the alloy will dissolve. Gold alloys greater than 14 K will still react with nitric acid (the copper or silver component of the alloy will still dissolve) but because there is less copper or silver to react the reaction will be much harder to observe.

## Extraction of Copper and Nickel from Low-Grade Nickel Sulfide Ore by 
Proportions of 99.13% nickel and 96.74% copper can be effectively extracted, while 95.95% iron was removed by selectively decomposing iron-containing sulfates to form ferric oxide, or separating as natrojarosite in a water-leaching process. Low-temperature roasting, selective decomposition and water-leaching were used to extract nickel and
