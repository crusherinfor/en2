4. Beneficiation of Copper Ore. The next step in processing is called beneficiation. This is the first step in concentrating the copper into a more useable form. 5. Smelting and Extraction. The next step in the process flow is smelting for sulfide ore concentrate and solvent extraction for oxide ore leach solution. 6.

## Nickel Ore Mining Process | Equipment | Flow | Cases - JXSC
Nickel Ore Mining Process. Nickel ore mainly consists of copper-nickel sulfide ore and nickel oxide ore, beneficiation and processing of both methods is completely different. Copper-nickel sulfide ore beneficiation methods: The most important is the flotation. The magnetic and the gravity separation is usually secondary dressing method.
