##  Construction Working and Maintenance of Crushers for Crushing Bulk 
A gyratory crusher uses a mantle that gyrates (rotates) within a cone shaped inner surface lined with wear resisting plates often called concaves. As the mantle gyrates within the crushing chamber, progressively approaching, and receding from, each element of the cone shaped inner surface, it creates compressive force, which fractures the

## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency - Pit & Quarry
This promotes stone-on-stone crushing, breaking up flaky or slabby particles. If you seek fewer fines, trickle feeding material into the jaw crusher could achieve this. But this would have an adverse effect on particle shape, and it also reduces throughput capacity, hindering the crusher's efficiency.  Feeding cone and gyratory crushers

Gyratory crushers are operated in open circuit. The feed is limited to 1 to 1.5 meters in size. Thus, based on reduction ratio, the rock size is reduced to 10 to 15 cm.  Cone Crusher Stone Grade Distribution. Gyradisk Cone Crusher. For finer size products (e.g., -6 mm), a special cone crusher known as the Gyradisc is commonly used.
