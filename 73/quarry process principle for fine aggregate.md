The primary use of aggregates — officially defined as crushed rock, gravel (naturally broken rock), and sand — is in construction projects: 20% home construction; 20% commercial construction; and 20% is used for public works projects, such as airports, sewage systems, and other municipal infrastructure. The rest, 40%, is used in making roads.
