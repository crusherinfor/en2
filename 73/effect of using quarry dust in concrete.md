The cheapest gravel for driveways is crusher run, crushed shells, crushed concrete, slate chips, recycled asphalt, and pea gravel, which all cost $15 to $30 per yard, or less than $1.With the different types of gravel in mind (and which to avoid), you can narrow your options and find the right type for your driveway.In terms of cost, check out the different types.

## Influence of Quarry Dust on Compressive Strength of Concrete - SRS Journal
Objectives: In the present study, by-product of stone crushed, quarry dust is replaced as a fine aggregate with 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% replacement.Methods/Analysis: The fine aggregate is being replaced with fine aggregate and the compressive strength is determined for the concrete by testing the sample cube. The properties such as the specific gravity, fineness modulus, moisture content etc. are
