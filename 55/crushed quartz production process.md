## How To Process Crushed Quartz
The manufacturing process begins with selection of raw quartz materials. They are crushed and blended in the ratio of 93 % quartz aggregates to 7% polyester resin and other additives. The mixture is compacted into slabs by a vacuum and vibration process of approximately 100 seconds at a pressure of about 100 tons.
