5. The ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal,pigments,and fedspar for pottery. Grinding can be carried out in either wet or dry but the former is carried out at low speeds. The advantages of wet grinding are less power consumption,increased capacity,no dust formation etc.. Dis advantages are high wear on the grinding medium

## How a Grate Discharge Ball Mill Works - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Each time the grate enters the mill charge, the horizontal force of the load in the mill deflects the grate. This stretches the rubber and forces any large material caught in the grate opening along through the grate slot. As the grate leaves the charge, the rubber assumes its original shape. This diaphragming action works the large particles

## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid over-grinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.
