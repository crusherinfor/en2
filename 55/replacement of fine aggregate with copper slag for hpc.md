## Copper slag as sand replacement for high performance concrete
It is recommended that 40 wt% of copper slag can be used as replacement of sand in order to obtain HPC with good properties.6. It should be noted that further research work is needed to explore the effect of copper slag as fine aggregates on the properties of concrete with different cement types, silica fume sources and the degree of fines.

## copper slag as sand replacement on hpc
Addition of up to 50% of copper slag as sand replacement yielded comparable High performance concrete Copper slag strength with that of the control mix. However, further additions of copper slag caused reduction in the Waste material strength due to an increase of the free water content in the mix.

## replacement of fine aggregate with copper slag for hpc
A Partial Replacement of Fine Aggregate by, - Know More. In this study we are using copper slag as a partial replacement to fine aggregates in concrete, in which cubes were casted for various grades of concrete and for various proportions of sand replacement with copper slag ranging from 20 to 50 Obtained results on different parameters like strength, workability and density were compared,
