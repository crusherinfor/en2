## acetone, benzene, ethyl alcohol, gasoline, and isopropyl alcohol. Class 
acetone, benzene, ethyl alcohol, gasoline, and isopropyl alcohol. Class IC liquids are have flash points at or above 73 °F (22.8 °C), but below 100 °F (37.8 °C). Typical Class IC liquids include. Isopropyl alcohol + phosgene forms isopropyl chloroformate and hydrogen chloride. In the presence of iron salts, thermal decompositon can occur, whicn in some cases can become explosive.
