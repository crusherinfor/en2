## Limestone: Rock Uses, Formation, Composition, Pictures - Geology
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.

## How is Glass Made: A Scientific Recipe of Sand, Soda and Lime
Sand melts into a liquid state at around 1700˚ C (or 30390˚ F)! In a commercial glass plant, sand is mixed with cullet (recycled glass pieces), soda ash and limestone and is then heated. The soda helps reduce the sand's melting point which helps reduce the overall energy—and cost—needed to melt it. The by-product of adding the soda is

## For example, fine whitebookdate
For example, fine white sand was mixed in for a "float finish." This finish was popular in the early 1900s. (If the plasterer raked the sand with a broom, the plaster wall would retain swirl marks or stipples.)  Finally, a little plaster of Paris, or "gauged stuff," was often added to the finish plaster to accelerate the setting time. Pour 1 ¼ cup of water into the mixing bowl.

To make Portland cement—the most common type of cement—powdered limestone is heated in a rotary kiln. As a source of calcium, it joins with powdered clay to produce a product called clinker, which is then ground with a source of sulfate, like gypsum. It is mixed with water, sand and crushed rock to create concrete.
