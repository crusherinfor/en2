## Extraction of Iron: Meaning, Purification, & Extraction Methods
Sep 27, 2021The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

However, the tin concentrate grade of 40% is required, meaning the enrichment of hundreds or thousands times. Targeting at the refractory tin ore, low grade tin concentrate is obtained and it has to be further extracted by special metallurgy process. Reduction smelting is the dominant process to extract tin metal from tin concentrate.
