Explanation: Mining operations often require large amounts of water to process ore or clean coal. So, they become another user of the freshwater system and may be in competition with agriculture, urban areas or simply the fish and organisms that occupy lakes and rivers.

## Subsidence issues due to mining | HomeProtect
Mining subsidence occurs when the earth beneath or near a property's foundations has been weakened or hollowed out by mining works. This causes the downward movement of the ground upon which a building sits. Access to disused mine sharts is generally blocked off by 'mine caps', but these can give way after years of decay, as they are often only

This kind of pollution occurs when chemical agents (such as cyanide or sulphuric acid used by mining companies to separate the target mineral from the ore) spill, leak, or leach from the mine site into nearby water bodies. These chemicals can be highly toxic to humans and wildlife. 4.

## Climate change and its impact on mining - International Mining
Posted by John on 26th May 2017. The focus on environmentally friendly practices and environmental issues like climate change has been a massive push over the past few years, and one of the industries that has had to adapt its practices more than others is the mining industry. Due to the fact that many mines are located in areas that can suffer

## Coal Mining - Strudex Mining
What is coal mining? Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal, since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate electricity. As one kind of energy, steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth.

The extraction of coal and coal seam gas (CSG) will generate produced water that, if not adequately treated, will pollute surface and groundwater systems. In Australia, the discharge of produced water from coal mining and related activities is regulated by the state environment agency through a pollution licence.

Explanation: Mining often involves large diesel trucks and loaders running around emitting CO2, which is the main contributor to anthropogenic climate change. Also, cutting trees down to make way for mining operations does reduce the value trees having in absorbing CO2 put into the atmosphere. Some mining companies, for example in the oilsands

## The Environmental Impact of Mining (Different Mining Methods Compared 
Underground mining, where miners tunnel beneath the Earth's surface to extract mineral deposits, is rarer than open-pit mining. In 2014, it made up about 5% of all American mining operations — and has less of an impact on the surface. However, this doesn't mean that underground mining doesn't have an effect on the environment.

Before the Industrial Revolution, two types of mines existed: drift mines and bell pits. Both were small-scale coal mines and the coal which came from these type of pits was used locally in homes and local industry. However, as the country started to industrialise itself, more and more coal was needed to fuel steam engines and furnaces.

The coal industry has a significantly negative environmental impact on the land, water, and air. It is responsible for producing pollution such as ash, sludge, slurry, arsenic, mercury, uranium, and other heavy metals that pollute the air and waterways. Additionally, coal processing has a negative effect on human health.
