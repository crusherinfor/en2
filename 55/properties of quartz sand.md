The antibacterial properties of CSCl@GO composites for complex bacteria in the cooling water system were researched. In addition, the CSCl@GO composites modified quartz sand filter media (CSCl@GO/QS) were synthesized. The antibacterial performance of CSCl@GO/QS filter media in secondary effluent of domestic sewage was also investigated.

About Sand. Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. The composition of sand varies, depending on the local rock sources and conditions, but the most common constituent of sand in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO2), usually in the form of quartz.

Artificial grass infill acts as a temperature regulator and keeps grass cooler than if you don't use infill. The backing of most artificial grass is black or dark green and will retain a lot of heat in the summer. Adding a light colored artificial grass infill sand creates a heat reflecting layer that keeps the turf cool by repelling heat.

It was assumed that the sand grains are spherical particles and dry material (non-cohesive). In the first step of the calibration process, the Sandglass test was performed to measure the macroscopic properties of quartz sand. Then the Sandglass was simulated by DEM for a varied range of coefficients of rolling and sliding friction.

Because of its chemical composition (SiO 2) and its specific properties, quartz can be used both as a bulk product (e.g. quartz sands in the glass or foundry industry) and as a high-tech material (e.g. piezo or optical quartz). Dependent on the specific conditions of either natural or synthetic formation, quartz can display typomorphic properties.

## Quartz Properties
One potential contaminant is sodium, which occurs naturally in the silica sand used to make fused quartz. This highly mobile ion can effectively destabilize the electrical characteristics of MOS and bipolar devices if not removed.  One of the most important properties of fused quartz is its extremely low coefficient of expansion: 5.5 x 10 -7

## Quartz Glass: What Is It? How Is It Made? Properties, Uses - IQS Directory
The majority of quartz comes from silica sand that is used to produce high purity quartz that has extra strength, clarity, and color. Extensive sand processing produces quartz with exceptional purity since the use of product chemistry removes any impurities. Quartz glass is valued due to its distinct and high value characteristics.
