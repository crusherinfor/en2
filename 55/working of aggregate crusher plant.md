## That's because there is a higher percentage of natural stone crushed 
That's because there is a higher percentage of natural stone crushed into the mix. Blacktop is heated to a higher temperature of around 300 degrees, about 50 degrees more than asphalt.A blacktop road lasts longer than concrete, as it can bend and be resealed season after harsh weather season.Typically the price ranges from $1,000 - $6,000 and beyond.
