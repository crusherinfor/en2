1. The process is limited to shallow water or the depth to which roots can penetrate. 2. The process can be time consuming. 3. There is a biological limit to the metals and compounds that can be captured. The various processes through with plants can incorporate pollutants are illustrated below and described in the following table:

Jan 16, 2021News Jan 16, 2021 Comments. The treatment of sand washing wastewater is nothing more than mud water separation. At present, the commonly used sand washing wastewater treatment process can be divided into two categories according to the different disciplines and technologies used in water treatment: one is physical and chemical method, the other is biological (biochemical) treatment method.

A leach field or septic drain field is the final processing step or sewage treatment in a septic system. Also known as a drain field, leech field or absorption field . The leach field as it is most commonly known as is a network of underground pipes containing many small holes to allow the wastewater to be distributed into the surrounding soil.
