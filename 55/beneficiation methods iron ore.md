## Iron ore beneficiation methods - Knowledge - Shanghai Kefid Machinery
Iron ore beneficiation methods. Beneficiation begins with the milling of extracted ore in preparation for further activities to recover iron values. Milling operations are designed to produce uniform size particles by crushing, grinding, and wet or dry classification. The capital investment and operation costs of milling equipment are high.

Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

Mineral processing is the first step for ore once it leaves the mine. The process involves ore preparation, milling, and ore dressing, commonly known as beneficiation. Beneficiation mechanically separates the grains of ore minerals from the gangue (low value) minerals that surround them in order to produce a concentrate made up of useful minerals.

Beneficiation is followed by processing activities such as smelting and refining. The beneficiation process begins with milling, which is followed by flotation for further beneficiation. At the first stage, extracted ores undergo the milling operation to produce uniformly sized particles for crushing, grinding, wet or dry concentration.
