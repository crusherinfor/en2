Most plants grow best at a pH of 6.0 to 7.4 - neutral. If the soil is lower than 5.9, dolomite lime can be used to elevate the pH so that it is a bit more alkaline and amenable to healthy plant growth. While neutral soil is preferred by most plants, soil pH occasionally can veer more into the acidic or more alkaline territory.
