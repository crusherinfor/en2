Due to the use of limestone as the main raw material instead of the usual petroleum-based plastics, the product has less than 50% of conventional plastic by weight. Bandai wants to reduce the use of petroleum-derived plastics by over 5 tons per year, while at the same time reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

## Material: Limestone · Art of Making
Material: Limestone. Limestone is a non-clastic sedimentary rock composed largely of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), usually formed at the bottom of shallow seas. The solubility of limestone makes it easily eroded; caves and sink-holes are typical features of limestone terrains. Limestone can vary substantially in hardness, the softer forms being

Limestone also helps to improve the handling and formability of the molten glass. In a pure silica melt, viscosity is high and this (alongside with high temperature) makes the glass difficult to shape, especially when it needs to hold a form, for example, in the production of glass containers. Limestone reduces the viscosity, making the liquid

To make Portland cement—the most common type of cement—powdered limestone is heated in a rotary kiln. As a source of calcium, it joins with powdered clay to produce a product called clinker, which is then ground with a source of sulfate, like gypsum. It is mixed with water, sand and crushed rock to create concrete.
