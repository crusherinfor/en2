## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.

## Open Pit Coal Mining Pros And Cons
Open pit mines can be used in coal mining and they are used extensively in hard rock mining for ores such as metal ores copper gold iron aluminum and many minerals In a open pit coal mine the pit bottom would be the bottom mined coal seam elevation since it is usually feasible to extract multiple seams when surface mining coal.

Although open pit mining (link to mining solution page) contributes about 85% of all mineral mining, it is one of the most environmentally taxing. About 73% of extracted rock goes to waste.  Coal production in Washington hit a high in 2003 with an estimated total production of 6,232,000 short tons,

Foreign mining companies had long objected to the ban on open-pit or surface mining in Category 2 lands, which also protected the province's most critical watersheds. Australian coal mining corporations, which had lobbied for the abolition of the Coal Policy, praised the Kenney government when their wish was granted last year.

## Open Pit Mining - IntechOpen
Feb 17, 2021Open pit mining is defined as the method of extracting any near surface ore deposit using one or more horizontal benches to extract the ore while dumping overburden and tailings (waste) at a specified disposal site outside the final pit boundary. Open pit mining is used for the extraction of both metallic and nonmetallic ores.

## Features of Open Pit Mining - 550 Words | Studymode
An open-pit mine is structured in steps, often also termed "benches," which are the pit's vertical levels. These steps commonly range from four to sixty meters, but the size is largely dependent upon the machinery used by the mining company. The walls of the pit are called the batter, while the flat portion is called the berm or the bench.
