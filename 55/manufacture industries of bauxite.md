Bauxite is the main source of the world's aluminum, supplying 99% of metallic aluminum . Bauxite is a member of the family of lateritic rocks. It is characterized by a particular enrichment of aluminum-hydroxide minerals, such as gibbsite, boehmite and/or diaspore. Bauxite is formed as a weathering product of low iron and silica bedrock.

## Mining and Refining - Bauxite Residue Utilisation - World Aluminium
Evidence from cement plants already using bauxite residue on an industrial scale demonstrate that bauxite residue can satisfactorily be used in cement clinker manufacture.

## Bauxite mining industry of Guinea and future prospects
Guinea, a small West African country with a population of 12.4 million and an area of 245,857 square kilometres, with bauxite potential of about 40 billion tons is the largest bauxite ore exporter in the world today. During 2019, the country exported about 70 million tons of bauxite, which is likely to exceed 110 million tons by 2021.
