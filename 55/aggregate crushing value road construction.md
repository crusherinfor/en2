## Aggregate crushing value Test and Procedure
Oct 31, 2021With aggregate of aggregate crushing value 30 or higher, the result may be anomalous, and in such cases the ten percent fines value should be determined instead. Crushing value is strength of the aggregates against crushing load. Aggregates undergo crushing in road construction and road operation work. If it gets crushed easily then road

These two aggregate samples were tested for sieve analysis test, relative density test, water absorption test, ten percent fine test, aggregate crushing value test (ACV), Aggregate impact value test (AIV), and Abrasion value test. Findings revealed that the best aggregate for road construction is the aggregate from Isi-Agu.

## Aggregate - Pavement Interactive
Aggregate " is a collective term for the mineral materials such as sand, gravel and crushed stone that are used with a binding medium (such as water, bitumen, portland cement, lime, etc.) to form compound materials (such as asphalt concrete and portland cement concrete). By volume, aggregate generally accounts for 92 to 96 percent of HMA and about 70 to 80 percent of portland cement concrete.
