## CAA - Beneficiation of high carbonate phosphate rock - Google 
ABSTRACT The amount of carbonate mineral impurities is reduced in aqueous phosphate rock slurry by (a) con-ditioning the slurry with an effective amount of CO2, (b) adding an effective amount of an anionic collector to the slurry and (c) subjecting the slurry to a froth flotation process whereby the carbonate mineral im-purities are concentrated in the froth.

Phosphate rock comes from geologic deposits located around the world. Its main constituent is apatite, a calcium phosphate mineral primarily extracted from sedimentary marine deposits, with a small amount obtained from igneous sources. Most phosphate rock is recovered through surface mining, although some is extracted from underground mines.

## Synthese. Lithiumhydroxide wordt bereid door
In 2005, lithium carbonate was further increased to 1.35 g/day and the preparation was changed to Quilonum Â®. Over the following 6 years serum concentrations of lithium were found to be stable between 0.56 and 1.15 mmol/L. Two weeks before admission, the patient developed a common cold and was later reported to have reduced his fluid intake.

## Phosphate Rock - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Rock phosphate. Rock phosphate is a naturally occurring ore of marine sedimentary origin. It may have a composition of 0-30-0, but the grade is noted as 0-3-0, since rock phosphate is sparingly soluble and little of the phosphorus is available to crops. Many of the mines that produced rock phosphate are closed, and most of the marketed rock
