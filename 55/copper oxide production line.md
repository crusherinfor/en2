## Copper Oxide - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Cuprite is a copper oxide mineral (Cu2 O) with cochineal-red, crimson-red, and black color and shining brown, red streak. Cuprite was discovered in 1845, and the name derived from the Latin word "cuprum" meaning copper. The distinctive red color crystal resembles "ruby" and known as "ruby copper.".

Copper oxide (CuO) is a semi-conducting compound with a monoclinic structure. CuO has attracted particular attention because it is the simplest member of the family of copper compounds and exhibits a range of potentially useful physical properties, such as high temperature superconductivity, electron correlation effects, and spin dynamics [61,62].

## The Copper-Oxide Rectifier - Industrial Electronics
To complete the copper-oxide rectifier cell, it is necessary to make electrical contact with the cuprous-oxide surface. This electrical contact with the cuprous-oxide can be made in a number of suitable ways. One method uses a lead washer or disc which is pressed against the oxide surface with a predetermined pressure.

The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.
