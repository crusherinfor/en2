## Predicting thermal conductivity behaviour of ZnO, TiO2 and ball milled 
TiO 2 /ZnO nanocomposite (TZO NC) is prepared by ball milling process where the powder mixture is placed in the ball mill in the required proportion i.e. 1:1 (2 g TiO 2: 2 g ZnO) which is then subjected to high energy collision process facilitated by tungsten carbide balls of 10 mm diameter. Here, the ball to powder weight ratio is fixed at 10:

Isolation of the product with ethyl acetate shadowed by vanishing of solvent was

## Effect of gallium doping and ball milling process on the thermoelectric 
For Ga-doped ZnO, Seebeck coefficient of -185 lV/K (at 1000 K) was achieved, which is ;30-45% higher than the values previously reported for Zn:Ga system. Jonker plot analysis was used to analyze the scope of Ga:ZnO bulk system. Keywords . process, milling, ball, doping, zno, type, gallium, n, effect, performance, thermoelectric . Disciplines

## ZnO catalysts prepared by ball milling - PDF Free Download
Cu/ZnO catalysts (with a Cu/Zn atomic ratio of 30/70) have been prepared by high intensity mechanical mixing of copper and zinc oxide powder in air and under vacuum. During milling in vacuum gradual amorphisation of the constituents occurs, as evidenced by broadening of the Cu0 and ZnO diffraction peaks in XRD, but the two original phases remain.
