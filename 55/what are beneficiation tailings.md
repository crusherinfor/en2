## How to generate value from tailings with reprocessing to be future 
We offer complete solution for reprocessing of tailings dams through its expertise in comminution and beneficiation, thus conserving ore and enabling profitability of mining operations. We firmly believe, dry stacking tailings is the way forward and a disruptive practice can virtually eliminate the need of tailings ponds in coming years besides

Wastewater produced by the mining industry is also known as tailings. Tailings contain waste from the extraction processes, equipment washing water and the refining process. It is a sludge-like waste that contains a mixture of fine gangue particles, chemicals and water; and in many cases is stored in large facilities called tailings dams or ponds.

The coal beneficiation tailing residue, called R1 in this work, was sieved (2.80-1.65 mm), washed with distilled water and dried at 100 ¬∞C for 24 h. Finally, the solid R1 was calcined at 973 K in a muffle furnace, in air atmosphere. The dry sample was stored in a desiccator. Aiming to improve sorption capacity, the surface was chemically modified.
