## Construction Aggregates 101: What They Are (and Why They Matter) - AEM
Aggregates are the most basic material used in construction. They provide the foundation for roads, bridges, and buildings, while also making up over 90% of an asphalt pavement and up to 80% of a concrete mix. On average, 38,000 tons of aggregates are necessary to construct one lane mile of interstate highway.

## Crushing effects on the durability of rocky aggregates used on road 
1. Introduction. Rocks are materials traditionally used in construction, either as natural stone in blocks or well crushed as aggregates due to their resistance and durability .This resistance and durability depends on the mineral components of the rock (mineralogy), their spatial distribution and grain or crystal size (texture), and the presence of empty spaces such as pores and fissures

Recycled Aggregate - California. When a road or structure is demolished, the rebar can often be seen protruding from the broken chunks of PCC. Recycled aggregate comes primarily from PCC and AC from road rehabilitation and maintenance, demolition, and leftover batches of AC and PCC. After processing, the rocks retain bits of cement or asphalt.
