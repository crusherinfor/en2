The Dawangshan Pit is an opencast limestone quarry with over forty-year mining history. It covers an area of 130,000 m 2. Its shape is an oval with a 500 m major axis and a 400 m minor axis.  Moreover, the reuse of abandoned pit should be forward-looking. That is to say, the planning and construction scheme of abandoned pit should be

## From The Quarry To The Kitchen: How Natural Stone Is Quarried
Limestone, gypsum, granite, marble, sandstone and slate are just a few of the many quarried materials. A great deal of work goes into determining quarry location and size where quality blocks can be extracted. Specialized drill bits are used to remove core samples. Those samples are then tested to ensure suitability.
