## deep opencast coal mining in australia
May 12, 2021In Australia, the majority of coal mining is done via the opencast method, although often the method of choice is dependent on certain characteristics of the coal deposit 1. The opencast, also referred to as the open-pit method, is the ideal technique when the coal seam is close to the surface.

## A review on existing opencast coal mining methods within Australia 
Currently almost 65 % of the coal in Australia is being produced by opencast mining methods. Mining equipments such as draglines, dredgers or bucket wheel excavators, trucks and shovels, and dozers are the main equipments employed for overburden removal and coal extraction. The choice of equipment for a particular mine depends on geological, geotechnical and economic factors and other site issues.
