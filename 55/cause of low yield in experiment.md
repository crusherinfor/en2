Therefore, according to the results, the aspirin obtained is relatively impure. However, the low percent yield can also mean that the reactant has not reacted completely or the reaction is not complete. However there is also another possibility for the lower percent yield value. It is the addition of water when carrying out suction filtration.

## Which factors determine the percentage yield in a laboratory 
Experimental preparations of compounds usually follow the standard methodology, i.e. 1. reaction. 2. work-up. 3. purification. The theoretical yield can be simply calculated froma knowledge of the stoichiometry of the reaction (s) involved in the preparation. The final percentage yield is calculated from actual yield/theoretical yield x 100%.

The percent yield is 91.2. Less than 10% of by-products were left in this chemical reaction resulting in a low amount of waste making the method an efficient one. A reason for the very low percent yield of trimyristin could be the fact that some product was lost as air was placed on the product to dissolve the solvent.

Although hydroxyapatite (HAP) can prominently lower Cd uptake by celery from Cd-polluted soil, its high application rates in reality may lead to high cost and potential environmental risk. Therefore, we aimed to clarify whether combined amendments of HAP and another low-cost material (hydrated lime, corn straw-derived biochar, or zeolite) with reduced application rate of each single amendment

## Nylonemeinschaft-wesermarsch
Nylon 66 composites reinforced by carbon fibre/polypropylene were produced by an injection moulding process. The results show that as the content of carbon fibre increases in nylon 66, the tensile property and impact breaking strength of composite material increases [11].Injection Molding Processing Conditions. The moisture content must be below 0.1% prior to processing.

## Why do I have a low yield of PCR product? | NEB
A primer concentration of 0.2 Î¼M is satisfactory for most PCR reactions. However, sensitivity and yield of RT-PCR reactions can be improved by increasing the primer concentration to above 0.5 Î¼M. Lower primer concentration between 0.07 Î¼M to 0.2 Î¼M may improve specificity. Increase cycling numbers up to 45 cycles. Do a manual hot-start.

## Why is my total cDNA yield low? - 10X Genomics
Question: Why is my total cDNA yield low? Answer: Total cDNA yield is highly dependent on the cell type (RNA amount per cell; see notes below), cell preparation, and the cell number (note that the number of PCR cycles for cDNA amplification is adjusted as a function of the targeted cell number). Causes: Low cDNA recovery may be the result of: Low total mRNA content per cell (cell-type dependent)
