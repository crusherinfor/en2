## Environmental and human health risks from cadmium  - ScienceDirect
1. Introduction. Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic heavy metal that occurs naturally in environmental media and as a contaminant emitted mainly from industrial sources, such as mining and metal smelting (Cui et al., 2016; Wlostowski et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2019).Generally, Cd is scarce in the earth's crust as a pure metal, and is principally associated with ferrous and non-ferrous metal ores.

## You can also recycle batteries at many Household Waste Recycling 
These batteries contain heavy metals such as zinc, manganese and copper, that, when landfills fail, will leach into the groundwater, polluting the very water we depend on for drinking and growing our food. . The vast majority of alkaline (also known as single-use or primary) batteries in the US are disposed and sent to landfills or incinerators

## Heavy metals in perfumeabel
Sometimes nitriles are used for adding a specific metallic context to a perfume, like in several provocative creations by Antoine Lie. Some people smell a metallic nuance in lavender. In a classic fougere, a cool lavender metal very often comes along with a metallic nuance of geranium, and balanced with the warmth of coumarin and balsamic materials.

## The Facts on Cadmium | Dartmouth Toxic Metals
Humans play a significant role in creating concentrated sources of cadmium and releasing it into the environment through activities such as mining, smelting and refining metal ores — particularly zinc, lead and copper. Cadmium is also emitted into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning, waste incineration and steel production.

##  Mineral Commodity Profiles: Cadmium - Usgs
Cadmium is associated in nature with zinc (and, less closely, with lead and copper) and is extracted mainly as a byproduct of the mining and processing of zinc. In 2000, it was refined in 27 countries, of which the 8 largest accounted for two-thirds of world production. The United States was the thir d largest refiner after Japan and China.

Cadmium is a relatively rare metallic element that occurs naturally in the environment in association with zinc ores and, to a lesser extent, with lead and copper ores.

Cadmium is a metal that lacks physiological roles in animals but is a well-established environmental toxicant. Human exposures to cadmium arise predominantly from mining, refining and electroplating industries, dietary contamination of food and water, and inhalation of polluted air, including tobacco smoke.

Manufacturing Causes CO2 Gas: Electric vehicles are propelled by lithium batteries, and their manufacture generates significant CO2 emissions.Lithium batteries cost roughly 73 kg CO2-equivalent/kWh. One battery with a capacity of 40 kWh or 100 kWh emits 2920 kg and 7300 kg of CO2, respectively.. That lithium is a midwife to a low-carbon economy makes it less ugly than coal and less evil than oil.

## Cadmium and zinc in polluted mining soils and uptake by plants (El 
Total cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) contents in soils around mine spoils ranged from 1.91?80 and 98?9200 mg/kg with an arithmetic mean of 28 and 4079 mg/kg, respectively. These amounts are much higher than the background levels. Higher concentrations of the labile form of Cd (20.7%) and moderate levels for Zn (7.6%) indicate a high environmental threat by these toxic elements.

## Occurrence, distribution, and volume of metals-contaminated  - USGS
The mine-waste piles and underground mines are continuous sources of trace metals (primarily lead, zinc, and cadmium) to the streams that drain the TSMD.  Lead and zinc were mined in the Tri-State Mining District (TSMD) of southwest Missouri, northeast Oklahoma, and southeast Kansas for more than 100 years. The effects of mining on the
