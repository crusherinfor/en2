## Mineral Resources: Examples, Types, Uses and Exploration
Examples of nonmetallic mineral resources include sand, stone, gravel, clay, gypsum halite, and Uranium. These minerals can be reprocessed through grinding, mixing, cutting, shaping for intermediate use. Fuel mineral resources are the basic mineral resources in the world, some examples of these include fossil fuels such as coal, crude oil

## When is a mineral considered a rock-forming mineral?
How do we consider a mineral as a rock-forming mineral? To be considered a common rock-forming mineral, a mineral must: A) be one of the most abundant minerals in Earth's crust; B) be one of the original minerals present at the time of a crustal rock's formation; and, C) be an important mineral in determining a rock's classification.

## What are minerals and What are economically important minerals?
A mineral is a chemical compound that has a precise chemical composition and is unstable and solid. It is a naturally occurring compound. It is unstable and the internal structure is ordered. Mineralogy is the study of minerals. Diamonds, emeralds, and sapphires produced in the industry are similar to gems, so they are called man-made minerals.

Oxides: When an ore is found in which one or more elements are combined with oxygen, it is an oxide mineral. These may have chemical formulas of the type XO (MgO, ZnO, CuO, etc.), X 2 O (Cu 2 O), X 2 O 3 (Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3), XO 2 (MnO 2, SnO 2) and XY 2 O 4 (MgAl 2 O 4, FeCr 2 O 4).The oxide minerals are mostly of metallic elements. Example: hematite, magnetite, and cuprite.

Classification of minerals. Since the middle of the 19th century, minerals have been classified on the basis of their chemical composition.Under this scheme, they are divided into classes according to their dominant anion or anionic group (e.g., halides, oxides, and sulfides).Several reasons justify use of this criterion as the distinguishing factor at the highest level of mineral classification.
