## Global cement emissions standards
Dust is emitted from storage, crushing, grinding and pyroprocessing in cement plants. It is the industry's most obvious pollutant, since you can actually see it. It can cause respiratory problems. Some of the earliest cement plant emission regulations were for dust. The German Cement Association (VDZ) set up a dust committee as early as the 1930s.

A typical raw mix consists of 75-85% limestone, 12-25% shale, the balance consisting of silica or quartzite and iron oxide. Exact proportioning is dependent upon their chemical properties before and after calcining to cement clinker. For good kiln practice the grind required is 88-92% - 200 mesh for standard cement, 99%-200 mesh for high early.
