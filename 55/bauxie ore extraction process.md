## TENORM: Bauxite and Alumina Production Wastes | US EPA
Bauxite is used to produce alumina, which is then used to produce aluminum. Wastes can be generated at several points in the production process, including during the mining of the bauxite ore, and during the refinery production process. The refinery processes used to produce aluminum generates about 2 - 2.5 tons of solid waste for every 1 ton

Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum and is a mixture of aluminum oxides and hydroxides that formed from intense chemical weathering of a soil in tropical environments. Soils formed under these conditions are termed laterites. In Arkansas, the aluminum-enriched soils are the result of the decomposition and lateritic weathering of nepheline syenite, an intrusive igneous rock. During the

Bauxite is best defined as an aluminum ore of varying degrees of purity in which aluminum in the form of aluminum hydroxide or aluminum oxide is the largest single constituent. The impurities are largely iron oxide, silica, and titania. Bauxite varies greatly in physical appearance, depending on its composition and impurities.
