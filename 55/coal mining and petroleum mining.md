## WHS (Mines and Petroleum Sites) legislation | NSW Resources Regulator
The NSW Work Health and Safety (Mines and Petroleum Sites) Act 2013 and NSW Work Health and Safety (Mines and Petroleum Sites) Regulation 2022 align specific mine safety laws with general work health and safety laws. They also provide a single legislative framework for the regulation of safety in mines and petroleum sites in all sectors (e.g. coal, metalliferous and extractive).

1. Introduction. Southwestern Pennsylvania has served for centuries as a producer of coal, oil, and natural gas. Coal mines were first developed in the Pittsburgh Coal Seam in the 1760s, with the first recorded mine in 1761 being the Fort Pitt Mine .Natural gas was introduced to the region when the Haymaker Well in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, experienced a blowout in November 3, 1878.

Uses of Coal. It is mainly used to generate heat and electricity. It is used in households and in industries to accomplish various tasks. It is the cheapest source of power fuel. The iron and steel industry depends heavily on fossil fuel for energy. It is also used to produce useful products such as coke, tar, and coal gas.

Most of the coal mining done from the 1800s to the 1920s and 30s (when oil started replacing coal as a fuel source in Texas) used underground methods, where vertical shafts or sloped adits (tunnel entrance) provided access to the mine workings. Surface strip mining (also known as area, open pit or open cast mining ) to extract lignite was used.

## Why Is Coal Not Considered A Mineral - Realonomics
Why is coal not a mineral? Minerals - Mineral is a naturally occurring inorganic solid with definite chemical composition and a crystalline structure. Coal is not a mineral because it does not qualify to be one. . Coal is non-living and made up of atoms of elements. Minerals are not formed from living things such as plants or animals.
