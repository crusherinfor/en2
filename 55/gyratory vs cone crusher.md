## Jaw Crusher VS Gyratory Crusher - Luoyang Dahua
Comparison of performance advantages of gyratory crusher and jaw crusher. The outstanding advantage of the gyratory crusher is that the crushing wall is large, which can reach -9.5, and sometimes it can be as high as 13.5. The production efficiency is high, and the work is relatively stable. Either side can feed ore and can be crowded with ore.

## gyratory crusher vs cone crusher -- VolPort
Jaw Crusher Vs Cone Crusher Which One To Choose. A cone crusher works in a similar way to a gyratory crusher, but in a cone crusher, the slope of the crushing space is not as steep. Although the cone crusher is well known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, it is better suited for secondary crushing.

## Gyratory Crusher & Cone Crusher Mantle Differences
In the Gyratory all the movement is in the bottom of the crusher mantle. This is due to the angle that the main shaft is on. The greater angle of the cone crusher puts the pivot point below the distributor plate. While the pivot point for the gyratory crusher is at the spider cap. This difference in the pattern of gyration has a purpose.

Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.
