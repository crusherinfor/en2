## Describe the distribution of iron ore in India. - Vedantu
Iron ore is the most important mineral used in the iron and steel industry to extract metallic iron. Secondary factories use extracted metal to make machinery, hand tools, and create structures, among other things. Complete answer: India has a lot of high-quality iron ores. Magnetite is the purest iron ore, with a heavy iron content of up to 70%.
