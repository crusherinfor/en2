## How it Works: Crushers, Grinding Mills and Pulverizers
Rock crusher. Material is reduced by crushers and grinders by fracturing, which takes place when the material is put under stress by the moving parts of the crushing or grinding equipment. Forces applied during the process may be compressive, shear or impact. The material fractures when the internal strain levels reach a critical level.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
