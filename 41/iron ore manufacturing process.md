## iron ore manufacturing process
Apr 02, 2010· Iron ore sintering is a material preparation process employed worldwide in the production of iron and steel. According to statistical data on pollution, sintering plants rank second in terms of toxic emissions, after the incineration of municipal solid waste (Menad et al., 2006; Remus et al., 2013 ).

As the industrial revolution developed, so did the iron industry. A set of innovations, from different materials to new techniques, allowed iron production to expand greatly. In 1709, Darby became the first man to smelt iron with coke (which is made from heating coal). Although this was a key date, the impact was limited — as the iron was

Iron is manufactured in a blast furnace. First, iron ore is mixed with coke and heated to form an iron-rich clinker called 'sinter'. Sintering is an important part of the overall process as it reduces waste and provides an efficient raw material for iron making. Coke is produced from carefully selected grades of coal.

## Pellet, iron ore concentrste, sintered iron ore: buy from Metinvest 
Iron ore concentrate is produced from the magnetite iron ore in the beneficiation process and is used for the production of pellets for blast furnaces and sinter. The concentrates are non-toxic, non-flammable and non-explosive. The concentrate is shipped as a bulk commodity by rail using the open-top rolling stock and by sea. Manufacturer: SevGOK.
