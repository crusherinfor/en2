## Copper Ore Leaching Sx
The leaching, solvent extraction and electrowinning LX-SX-EW process is a widely used method in the production of copper from low-grade oxidized ore. Copper is the most common metal to be processed by LX-SX-EW, but the process can also be used to extract, purify and concentrate other metals, such as nickel, cobalt and zinc.

How is blister copper extracted from its sulphide ore? When copper is made from sulfide ores by the first method above, it is impure. The blister copper is first treated to remove any remaining sulfur (trapped as bubbles of sulfur dioxide in the copper - hence "blister copper") and then cast into anodes for refining using electrolysis.

## Copper extraction
All primary sulfide ores of copper sulfides, and most concentrates of secondary copper sulfides (being chalcocite), are subjected to smelting.Some vat leach or pressure leach processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting leachate solution, but this is a minor part of the market.. Carbonate concentrates are a relatively minor product

Figure 2: Surface of Chalcopyrite Leach Residue With and Without Jetti Catalyst . Mike Outwin, Jetti Resources Co-Founder and CEO said, "Pinto Valley was a perfect candidate to pioneer our breakthrough technology given the abundance of copper resources available for leaching and the underutilized plant and infrastructure in place.

## Solvent Extraction & Electrowinning (SX/EW) Plant Design
Copper was extracted on asphalt-lined leach pads and recovered in the first solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) plant in Latin America. Production capacity was 33,000 metric tonnes per year (mtpy) of high purity copper cathodes. At the time, the use of solvent extraction followed by electrowinning for low grade, impure leach solutions
