To make Portland cement—the most common type of cement—powdered limestone is heated in a rotary kiln. As a source of calcium, it joins with powdered clay to produce a product called clinker, which is then ground with a source of sulfate, like gypsum. It is mixed with water, sand and crushed rock to create concrete.

The quarrying process is also known as "extraction.". This procedure consists of removing blocks or large pieces of stone from a previously identified geological deposit. The different methods used to quarry or extract the limestone depends on the specific properties of the limestone deposit itself, including density, bedding planes, and depth.

The exploitation requires the removal and disposal of about 50 million cubic metres (Mm3) of overburden material during the 20-year quarry lifespan. Limestone deposit is covered by a 50-70 m thick layer of soil-clayey sand and clay-which has to be removed by means of excavators/shovels and chain bucket excavator.

Limestone quarrying began in the early 1800's and continues today. Small amounts of impure limestone have been quarried in many parts of the state, but the only place that has produced a significant amount of lime is the Rockland-Thomaston area. The "limestone" there is a metamorphosed coarse-grained marble, some of which is quite pure.
