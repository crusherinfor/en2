## How Is Quartz Extracted? - Mining-pedia
This quartz mining process mainly relies on the friction between mechanical force and quartz particles to wipe away the iron film or adhesive materials in quartz sand surface, at the same time, it can further crush quartz particles. Then use hydrocyclone to separate fine particles from slurry, then obtain higher purity quartz sand.

## Limestone extraction - underground mining techniques, drilling 
A foremost element of the mining process is breaking up the rock. This breakup is accomplished by detonating volatiles set in blast holes. The rock face to be gusted is typically 40-feet in width by 20- to 25-feet high. A premeditated pattern of 40 to 50 horizontal holes are drilled for the dimensions of 2 inches wide by 12- to 14-feet deep.
