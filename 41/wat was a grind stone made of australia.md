## What Is Grinding Stone
The grinding surface of these "runner" stones, or top stones, is concave and carved in spoke patterns. The runner stone sits atop another "bed stone" or "nether stone," which is also carved. As the top stone rotates, the grain first gets cracked in the middle of the two stones, then is pushed to the outside by the spoke-like pattern.
