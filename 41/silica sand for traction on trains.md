## How do locomotive sanders work? Discussion
When the silica (sand) is crushed between the wheel and rail, there is a plasma arc that is set up that attracts the wheel and rail to each other. This in a way temporarily "welds" the wheel and rail together. This "weld" action is broken by the effort of the traction motors and the weight and momentum of the Locomotive.
