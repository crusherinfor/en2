Sewage Grinder Pumps have the ability to do this, pumping liquid at nearly 60 P.S.I. Sewage Grinder pumps normally have a 1-1/4'' discharge and range from 2 HP and up. They will pump low volumes of sewage (30 Gallons Per Minute or less), but can push it over longer distances (thousands of feet) and can handle head pressures of up to 130 feet.

Continuous dressing at about 20 to 60 millionths per revolution — preferably with a diamond roll — reduces cutting times and keeps the wheel sharp.
