## Limestone extraction - underground mining techniques, drilling 
Limestone is a sedimentary rock comprising about 15% of the earth's sedimentary crust. Limestones are generally mined in the method of open pit mining and underground mining based on the economic and environmental conditions. Surface limestone mining. All over the world, the limestones are generally mined from a quarry or the open pit mining.

The study site is underlain by an abandoned underground limestone mine developed in the Wymps Gap Limestone member of the Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation. Portals or entrances into the mine, lead to drifts or tunnels driven into the limestone; these entries provided access to the limestone where it was extracted by the room-and-pillar method.

Underground mining of limestone has some advantages over surface quarrying and will probably increase in the future. Typical public concerns about limestone mining include dust, noise, blasting vibration, and truck and other traffic associated with quarry operations. Some limestones are also aquifers, that is, they are rock units that can yield

Most limestone and dolomite are mined from open quarries, although in many areas economic and environmental considerations favor large-scale production by underground mining. The only carbonate materials not consistently recovered by surface or underground mining are shell products that are dredged from parts of U.S. coastal waterways.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
