## Want the Look of Limestone? Use Concrete - Concrete Decor
A California company has created a clever disguise — a concrete product that looks like quarried limestone block. ArcusStone, based in Oakland, Calif., manufactures crushed limestone coatings and plasters that produce the finish of quarried stone, but with increased strength and durability due to the portland cement and polymers in the mix.

## Preparation and Properties of Lime Concrete
A concrete made from a mixture of lime, sand, and gravel is said to be as lime concrete. It was widely used before the lime was replaced by Portland cement. Since long, Lime has been used to make things like plaster and mortar. Lime is usually made by burning of limestone.Chemically; lime itself is calcium oxide (CaO) and is made by roasting calcite

Whereas the U.S. standard for portland cement allows for up to 5% of clinker to be replaced by limestone, the standard for blended cement allows for 5% to 15% limestone replacement in PLC (Type IL).

## How To Break Limestone Rock - Realonomics
Is limestone easy to break? Limestone is a soft rock that is relatively easy to carve and can have a wide variety of textures. Composed of the mineral calcite it formed on the ocean floor from sediment and the bodies of early sea creatures. . Limestone has natural bed lines that make it easier to break apart and are more visible when wet.

To make Portland cement—the most common type of cement—powdered limestone is heated in a rotary kiln. As a source of calcium, it joins with powdered clay to produce a product called clinker, which is then ground with a source of sulfate, like gypsum.

Rounded off it's basically a 1 : 3 : 3 mix ratio. If I break the weights down per yard of concrete it comes to: 1. Cement = 510.75 pounds. 2. Stone = 1658.75 pounds. 3. Sand = 1496.25 pounds. A sack or "bag" of cement weighs 94 pounds so this tells us a 3000 psi concrete mix is also equal to a 5.5 sack mix of concrete.

Aggregate is the granular material - such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, crushed hydraulic-cement concrete, or iron blast-furnace slag - that makes up between 60% and 70% of the volume of concrete. The type of aggregate used determines the durability, strength, thermal properties, and density of the hardened concrete.

## Portland-Limestone Cement - National Precast Concrete Association
The use of limestone in the cement can slightly decrease bleeding based on its fineness but generally does not have an effect. Set Time. Based on studies, it appears that cements with limestone may have a slight effect on setting time; however, this should not constitute a concern for the addition rates of 15% or less.
