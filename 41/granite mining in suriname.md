## Granite | Properties, Formation, Composition, Uses - Geology Science
Granite. Granite is the most common intrusive rock in Earth's continental crust, It is familiar as a mottled pink, white, gray, and black ornamental stone. It is coarse- to medium-grained. Its three main minerals are feldspar, quartz, and mica, which occur as silvery muscovite or dark biotite or both. Of these minerals, feldspar predominates

According to Suriname's Planning Office, small scale goldmining produced 14,800 kg of gold in 2020. The state-owned mining company, Grassalco, began recovering gold from reprocessed ore in 2014. The company also started exporting gravel

## Gold mining - EITI Suriname
The development of large-scale gold mining in Suriname faced other difficulties. Between 1974 and 1977, the Government explored the gold deposits in the Gross-Rosebel area in a joint venture relationship with the Canadian gold mining company Placer Dome. However, the results were marginal. In 1979 the State Mining Company N.V. Grassalco

## How Granite is Extracted from the Earth - Engineering Specialists, Inc.
Extracting the Rock. Granite is usually formed into slabs or large deposits. There are different methods used by mining companies to cut and extract the deposits from the ground which are called quarries. When the granite is extracted, the mining team uses large equipment such as extractors and cranes to slowly dig around the deposits.

Suriname is rich in natural resources that include bauxite, gold, kaolin and small amounts of iron ore, platinum, copper, and nickel. The economy of the country largely depends on its mining industry. The country's economic growth rate reduced to 2.2% in 2009 from 7% in 2008, owing to the fall in commodity prices in global markets.
