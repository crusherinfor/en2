If red mud is completely neutralised, 15-20 times the volume of sea water is required. This requires extensive and expensive pumping and although results in an inert product, it is completely worthless. However, Virotec has found that slightly less than complete neutralisation can be achieved with much less seawater.

Some of the sodium hydroxide used in the process is left within the waste which raises its pH. The residue goes through several processes to recycle the sodium hydroxide and make the refining process as efficient as possible. Recycling the sodium hydroxide also lowers the alkalinity of the red mud which makes them safer to store and handle.

## Reducing red mud generation through dry pre-processing of bauxite
Red mud is the waste product generated by what is known as the Bayer Process when refining bauxite to produce alumina (aluminum oxide). Via a purification process, alumina can be refined to produce aluminum. However, bauxite—which is the most important ore available for producing aluminum—may contain only 30-60% aluminum oxide.

## Production - Red Mud Project
Red Mud is produced during the Bayer Process. With this process, we can extract the aluminum (oxy)hydroxides from bauxites and get alumina, which eventually can be smelted and give aluminum. Bayer Process In 1888, Karl Josef Bayer developed and patented a process, which has become the cornerstone of the aluminium production industry worldwide.

Abstract Bauxite residue (red mud) is a process reject composed of undissolved bauxite phases during digestion in the Bayer process. Rare earth elements present in the bauxite residue could be a potential resource for the extraction of REEs (Sc, La, Ce). It is difficult to recover REEs directly from red mud due to its low concentration and the presence of major minerals. Large amounts of iron

## Mining and Refining - Bauxite Residue Management - World Aluminium
Bauxite residue is a by-product of the Bayer Process. It is primarily composed of the insoluble fraction of the bauxite ore that remains after extraction of the aluminium-containing components. Iron oxides (10 - 30%), titanium dioxide (2 - 15%), silicon oxide (5 - 20%) and undissolved alumina (0 - 20%) make up the residue, together with

## Pedersen process
The Pederson process is a process of refining aluminum that first separates iron by reducing it to metal, and reacting alumina with lime to produce calcium aluminate, which is then leached with sodium hydroxide. It is more environmentally friendly than the more well-known Bayer process. This is because instead of producing alumina slag, also known as red mud, it produces pig iron as a byproduct.

## Reduction of Red Mud Discharge by Reductive Bayer Digestion: A 
The utilization of valuable minerals in bauxite or red mud is an important measure to reduce the waste discharge generated by the Bayer process;10,11 the proposed methods can be accordingly divided into two categories: (a) for treating bauxite ore: gravity/magnetic beneficiation,12 flotation,13 reductive roasting-iron separation,14,15 biological beneficiation,16 and wet chemical desilication
