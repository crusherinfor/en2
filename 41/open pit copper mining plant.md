8.2.3.1 Open pit mining. Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.
