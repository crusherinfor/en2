The load for 10% of fines value for this aggregate is 34.3% and thus the aggregate value for wearing surfaces shall not exceed45% (Bhattacharjee, 2015). References. Bhattacharjee, M. (2015).

The method of aggregate test specifies the procedure for determining the aggregate impact value of coarse aggregate. Aggregate impact value is used to classify the stones in respect of their toughness property as indicated below: <10% Exceptionally strong. 10-20% Strong. 20-30% Satisfactory for road surfacing. 35% Weak for road surfacing. The
