Concrete slabs can develop voids from a variety of reasons, ranging from sliding soil beneath the slab displaced because of a lack of proper compression, to water erosion slowly washing away the soil over time. Voids can lead to a weakness in the slab, causing dips in the surface, tilting or cracks and breaks.

## Behaviour of Paver Blocks With Partial Replacement of Sand Using Quarry 
The reduction in the sources of natural sand has resulted in the increased need to identify substitute material to sand as fine aggregate in the production of Paver Blocks. Quarry dust, a by-product from the crushing process during quarrying activities is one of such materials. Granite fines or rock dust is a by-product obtained during crushing of granite rocks and is also called quarry dust.
