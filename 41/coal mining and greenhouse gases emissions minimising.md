## Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions of Major Technology Companies in 
Cisco is a leading Scope 3 greenhouse gas emitter. In 2021, Cisco's Scope 3 emissions accounted for 75.25 million tonnes CO2 equivalents (MtCO2eq) which is 99.74% of Cisco's total GHG emissions. To reduce GHG emissions, the technology company has set a goal to achieve net-zero across Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions by 2040.

Fugitive emissions from coal mining account for 8.9% of NSW greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 emissions in ). Most of these emissions are from underground coal mines in the form of ventilation air methane (VAM).

## Net zero vs carbon neutral-cut
The key difference is that carbon neutral deals only with CO2, while net zero deals with all greenhouse gases, including CO2.Net zero also focuses on reducing emissions as much as possible and only offsetting as a last resort, whereas carbon neutral allows companies to continue emitting as long as they balance it out with carbon offsets.

## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

## Coal, oil and gas projects emitting greenhouse gases above estimates 
Two of Whitehaven Coal's mines in New South Wales - the Maules Creek open cut coal mine and the Narrabri underground coal mine - were found to have emitted somewhere between 2.5 and 4.5 times
