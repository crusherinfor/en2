## Concrete Lab Report | Concrete | Strength Of Materials
Compression tests (ASTM C 39) are conducted to determine the compressive strength of concrete (or its ability to resist a crushing force). In this test, a standard test load is applied parallel to the longitudinal axis of a pre-molded and properly cured concrete cube of a standard size (BS 1881—125:2013). When the test is properly conducted

Concrete Cube Test Dimensions. In the UK the crushing strength of concrete is measured using compressive strength tests of concrete involve the crushing of 150mm cubes. The correct standard concrete cube size is ensured by using a standard concrete cube mould. In the US and most of Europe the compressive strength of a concrete cylinder is measured.

One of many reasons of the discoloration of the lips is anemia, which is the result of an iron deficiency. It is more common during pregnancy, but anyone with anemia will have darkened lips because of a reduction in the oxygen-carrying compound called hemoglobin.

## Why are concrete cubes soaked in water befire crushing
Apr 01, 2018 The crushing of concrete cubes or cylinder samples is required in a construction especially concrete structures. The reason why this is to verify the strength given in the design mix. Let say for example for a concrete column commonly it has 60 megapascals of specified strength. When you crush it, the result should be equal or more
