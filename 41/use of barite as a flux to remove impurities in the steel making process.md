In metal refining, flux is used to help remove impurities and change the fluidity of the melt. Once activated by the furnace's high temperatures, the flux breaks down and lowers the melting points of all the other materials in the crucible.

There are two main processes for producing steel: by means of a blast furnace (= indirect reduction) in combination with a converter, or by means of an electric furnace. In the former process, iron ore is the main raw material. In an electric furnace, scrap iron is used and occasionally also sponge iron. Sponge is an intermediate product, which

## Pickling: An Overview of This Metal Treatment Process
Pickling is a metal treatment process that removes superficial impurities from metal. It's called "pickling" because it involves the use of an acidic solution known as pickle liquor. The exact composition of the pickle liquor varies depending on the type of metal on which it's used.

## use of barite as a flux to remove impurities in the steel making process
How is steel making similar to welding processes? Both use a flux to remove impurities. Both processes use an inert shielding gas to protect the molten metal from oxidation. Both have a way of controlling the carbon content to control the hardness of the metal. They really are not similar in any way.

## Silicon Barium Calcium in Steelmaking
Silicon barium calcium is a common additive in steelmaking, it can form oxide impurities such as oxygen in the steel and often used as a deoxidizer. Moreover, it is different from other types of deoxidizers that the silicon barium calcium can exert its deoxidation effect during deoxidation, and the deoxidation effect is good, this is also a characteristic of multi-de-oxide agents.

##  Management of Lime in Steel - MDPI
Despite the development of many new industries using lime, the steel industry today remains the major consumer, consuming almost half of the annual lime production. Most of the steel processes involve the use of lime as a ๏ฌux. Industrial lime production today allows the quality adapted to the needs of different steel applications to be reached.
