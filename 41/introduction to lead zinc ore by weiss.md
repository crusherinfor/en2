Lead and Zinc Energy. 6.1.1 Lead and Zinc Ore Mining Lead and zinc ore is nearly always mined below the surface of the ground. Some veins of ore lie as deep as several thousand feet but most deposits lie close to the surface. Lead and zinc ore is mined almost exclusively in underground operations, though a few surface operations do exist. Know more

lead and zinc are almost immiscible just above their melting points; silver is much more soluble in zinc than in lead; silver/zinc alloys have higher melting points than pure zinc. At 863 K zinc is removed by transferring the lead to a 'dezincing kettle'. At this stage the desilvered lead contains about 0.6% zinc and 0.0004% silver.

Marmatite ( (Zn,Fe)S) is an iron-rich sphalerite which consequently results in lower zinc concentrate grades. Marmatite concentrates have a lower zinc level due to dilution from the iron minerals. Separations are made possible by galena's inherent natural hydrophobicity and due to the fact that sphalerite as a mineral is not easily collected

Lead was the first metal mined in Australia at Glen Osmond in South Australia in 1841, after the wheel of a cart being pulled up a rough track accidentally exposed some lead-zinc ore. In 1876, lead-silver ore was discovered and mined at Thackaringa, near Broken Hill in New South Wales, but the mines closed in 1877.
