## Manufacturing Causes CO2 Gas: Electric vehicles are propelled by
Manufacturing Causes CO2 Gas: Electric vehicles are propelled by lithium batteries, and their manufacture generates significant CO2 emissions.Lithium batteries cost roughly 73 kg CO2-equivalent/kWh. One battery with a capacity of 40 kWh or 100 kWh emits 2920 kg and 7300 kg of CO2, respectively.. That lithium is a midwife to a low-carbon economy makes it less ugly than coal and less evil than oil.

A form of surface mining in which bulldozers, power shovels, or stripping wheels remove the overburden in strips. It is used in areas with fairly flat terrain. An earthmover strips the overburden and then a power shovel digs a cut to remove the mineral deposit. It is typically used for coal and some phosphate rock.

## How Do You Mine Iron - Realonomics
How is iron extracted from the earth? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

Iron Ore Mining Techniques Metal Extraction. Iron ore is the unrefined substance utilized to formulate pig iron, which is one of the most important untreated materials to compose steel. 98% of the hauled out iron ore is used to produce steel. Iron ores are rocks and mineral deposits from which clanging iron can be reasonably extracted.

What is iron mining? Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. Where is most iron ore mined?

LFP (Lithium Ferrophosphate or Lithium Iron Phosphate) is currently our favorite battery for several reasons. They are many times lighter than lead acid batteries and last much longer with an expected life of over 3000 cycles (8+ years). Initial cost has dropped to the point that most of our LFP battery banks break even with lead acid cost.

How To Extract Iron? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth?
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however, because iron does not occur naturally, it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
