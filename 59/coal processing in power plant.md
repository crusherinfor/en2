## Radioactive Wastes From Coal-fired Power Plants | US EPA
Radiation Facts. The process of burning coal at coal-fired power plants, called combustion, creates wastes that contain small amounts of naturally-occurring radioactive material. Coal is a fossil fuel used to produce power in the United States. Coal contains trace amounts of naturally-occurring radioactive elements.

## Thermal Power Plant - Basic, Definition, Parts, Working Principle
A thermal power plant is one kind of plant or system, which is used to produce electrical power by using thermal energy. Fig. 1 Thermal power plant. Coal is mainly used as fuel. Normally brown, bituminous, and peat coals are widely used. Water is used as secondary fuel which helps to transfer thermal energy from coal.
