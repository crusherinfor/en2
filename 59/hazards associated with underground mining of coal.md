For example, mine roof collapses account for a large portion of underground deaths and injuries. Respirable coal mine dust, which can lead to 'black lung' disease, and harmful noise levels remain persistent health concerns. In addition, the introduction of new mining technologies may create new hazards non yet recognized in the field.

Underground mining is generally more complicated than surface mining and the hazards to the miners are greater. About 75 percent of all coal mining fatalities occurred in underground mines. The U.S. Bureau of Mines identifies roof falls as the number one killer in coal mining (see Figure 1.1). More than 40 percent of the fatalities

## 145+ Brilliant Coal Mining Safety Slogans
Coal mining deep underground involves a higher safety risk than coal mined in opencast pits, due primarily to problems associated with mine ventilation and the potential for mine collapse. However, there are safety risks associated with all forms of coal mining, not least because of the heavy machinery utilized in coal excavation.
