When sanding or filing soft metals a lighter touch goes a long way to ensureing that the chips taken off by the grit or teeth are small enough that they do not clog the sanding material or the file teeth.

The Mining Process. 1. Mining - open pit and underground. To define the ore from the waste rock, samples are taken and assayed. Assay results are used to mark out areas of ore and waste rock, which are mined separately. Some of the harder areas require blasting to loosen the rock prior to excavation by hydraulic diggers.

## Brass
Brass is an alloy of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), in proportions which can be varied to achieve varying mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties. It is a substitutional alloy: atoms of the two constituents may replace each other within the same crystal structure.. Brass is similar to bronze, another alloy containing copper that uses tin instead of zinc.
