## Different Types of Mining | 4 Types of Mining - Mine Services - AMS
Surface mining is a process where ore is extracted from the ground by digging it out with heavy machinery. The ore is then transported away from the mine site.  Once the tunnels have been made, the miners use equipment such as drill rigs to dig through the rock and remove the ore. After the ore has been extracted, it needs to be transported

## Open Pit Mining Equipment For Sale |Boyd CAT IN & KY
Open-pit mining is an extremely effective surface mining technique for extracting minerals, coal and other useful materials that are covered by relatively thin overburden layers. However, it takes the right equipment to penetrate the surface rock and reach the underlying layer in a timely and efficient manner.
