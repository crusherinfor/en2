## Copper extraction
The average grade of copper ores in the 21st century is below 0.6% copper, with a proportion of economic ore minerals (including copper) being less than 2% of the total volume of the ore rock. A key objective in the metallurgical treatment of any ore is the separation of ore minerals from gangue minerals within the rock.

It is also possible to change a group for half a year, and the life of the lithium battery can reach 3-5 years. Therefore, the initial cost of lithium batteries is relatively high, while the maintenance, replacement and labor costs in the later period are much lower than those of lead-acid batteries.4. With charge and use. Lithium batteries.

## flotation concentrate s
Jun 19, · Flotation Circuit: Concentrate Grade and Recovery. The texture of particles within a flotation cell play a pivotal role in both mineral recovery, and the grade, in the flotation concentrate. Theoretical curves can be generated based on particle mineralogy and texture to indicate the maximum graderecovery possible for a given feed ore.

## These three elements are the most critical for EV batteries. An average 
The process is long and yields relatively little lithium. Both of these extraction methods can damage local environments and have shown the capacity to have a negative impact far beyond the confines of their mining operation. Acquiring lithium via these processes does not qualify as sustainable - but there are solutions that can turn the tide.

## Nickel Mines, Nickel Extraction Process, Nickel Recovery - Xinhai
The mixing flotation process is to separate nickel ore in which copper has lower content than Nickel, the mixed concentrate of copper and nickel will smelt into high grade nickel directly.  Copper nickel can be get from raw ore, then the copper concentrate with low grade nickel and the nickel concentrate with low grade copper can be separate
