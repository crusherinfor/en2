After a coal mine is abandoned, it often leaches highly acidic water, which then flows into surrounding ecosystems. To date, more than 6,000 mines have been abandoned in South Africa, with damages from acidic water requiring an estimated 30 billion rand ($2.67 billion) in clean-up costs nationwide, according to a WWF report.
