## Reduction Ratio - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Friction reduction ratio is the function of the average velocity of fracturing fluid, the gelled agent concentration, and the proppant concentration. Based on the linear regression of 1049 experimental and field data, Lord et al. put forward the following empirical formula to calculate the friction reduction ratio of HPG fracturing fluid (Lord, 1987):

## How Is Reduction Ratio Of Hammer Mill Calculated
Reduction ratio is inversely proportional to the hammer mill sieve size. Due to decrease in sieve size, the reduction increased rapidly. This shows the extent of grinding and by using lower sieve size in hammer mill finest particle can obtain. In the reduction ratio is very high compared to hammer mill because average particle size is very less.
