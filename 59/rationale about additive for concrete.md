## Introduction to Polymer-Modified Concrete
Introduction to Polymer-Modified Concrete. Concrete is an ancient material. It was used in the Middle East as early as 6,500 B.C. to construct floors, housing structures and underground cisterns. In the Roman era, circa 600 B.C., concrete was used even more extensively. Roman engineers..
