## Siderite - GSU
Siderite is a carbonate mineral of iron. It has the composition FeCO 3. The origin of this sample is Lukmanierschlucht, Grissons, Medel, Switzerland. It is on display in the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. The sample measures about 12x12 cm. Siderite is a member of the calcite group of carbonates along with rhodochrosite and Smithsonite.

## Siderite Value, Price, and Jewelry Information
Siderite forms three solid-state solution series. It's the iron (Fe) analogue in a series with manganese (Mn) dominant rhodochrosite. It also forms the Fe-end of a series with zinc (Zn) dominant smithsonite, as well as with magnesium (Mg) dominant magnesite. Siderite has been used as an iron ore and for steel production.

## Siderite
Siderite is a mineral composed of iron(II) carbonate (FeCO 3).It takes its name from the Greek word σίδηρος sideros, "iron". It is a valuable iron mineral, since it is 48% iron and contains no sulfur or phosphorus. Zinc, magnesium and manganese commonly substitute for the iron resulting in the siderite-smithsonite, siderite-magnesite and siderite-rhodochrosite solid solution series.

Static code analysis is a process for analyzing an application's code for potential errors. It is "static" because it analyses applications without running them, which means an application can be tested exhaustively without constructing a runtime environment or posing risk to production systems.
