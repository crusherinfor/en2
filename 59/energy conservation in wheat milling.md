Step 1: Grain Receiving and Storage, Wheat is received at our mill by trucks year-round with the July wheat harvest being our busiest. Most of the local wheat comes from the western part of Afghanistan. Milling is the process of machining flat, curved, or irregular surfaces by feeding the workpiece against a rotating cutter containing a number

## Energy use and economic analysis for wheat production by conservation 
Net energy for wheat production was reported to be 19.90 and 22.30 GJ ha −1 for irrigated and dryland production  energy indices were compared based on the energy input-output and wheat production. In general, under all energy indices, conservation tillage along with sprinkler irrigation system performed better than conventional tillage

## Wet Milling vs Dry Milling: The Differences, Advantages, and Challenges 
What is milling? The use of mechanical energy to break down particles through various mechanical forces including grinding media, pegs, rods, pebbles, and screens. When the material is pumped through the mill, the mill's components act on the solids in the mixture to tear them apart or crush them, further reducing them in size.

Use an energy-efficient space heater and you'll be able to save on heating costs even more while protecting the platen at the same time. If you install the recommended 270mm insulation, heated air will be held in for longer. That, in turn, means you don't need to run your central heating for as long as you used to.
