For the Paxton Air System, a 5 hp blower will supply three 6' air knives, providing 200 cfm air at 60" of water column. The Paxton System will use only 3.3 hp compared to 22.8 hp for the existing compressed air system, resulting in an energy savings of about $1.50 per hour and yielding an ROI of less than 11 months for a 24 x 5 day operation.
