To concentrate phosphate rock in apatite (BPL or P2O5 content) we have to separate impurities from apatite using a beneficiation process. The beneficiation process could include a large variety of operations depending on the rock impurities content, the particles size and their hardness.  The slurry is pumped to a beneficiation plant.
