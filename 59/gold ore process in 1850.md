## Gold ore | Fallout Wiki | Fandom
Gold ore is a miscellaneous item in Fallout 76. A chunk of gold-yielding ore. It can be smelted down with acid at a chemistry station to produce gold scrap. Ten gold ore pieces are found northeast of Spruce Knob, north of the train tracks. Three pieces inside the glassed cavern. One can be found at Hornwright Industrial Headquarters, in the basement. Several gold ore veins can be found in the

During roasting, refractory gold ore is treated with extremely hot air. This causes the sulfites to oxidize, separate from the ore, and become sulfur dioxide. Once all of the sulfides are oxidized, the remaining gold ore can be processed normally. The roasting method has been around for hundreds of years. Prior to the 20th century, the process

Gold is produced at some mines as part of the process of mining and refining other metals, such as copper. At those operations, gold is refined to an acceptable purity as part of the copper production process. At most gold mines, the gold "dore" is sent to a refinery for further processing.

In 1855, world gold production made a minor peak at an estimated at 227 tons, a tenfold expansion from 1840. (Gold production today is about 2,700 tons per year.) That is a pretty big jump. No doubt about it. If there was ever going to be any kind of major change in gold's value due to mining supply, this would cause it.

A total of 165Mt of ore will be mined, with 32Mt processed at a grade of 1.65g/t during the lifetime of the mine. Gold ore processing. The ore will be processed through a conventional two-stage grinding circuit consisting of SAG and ball mill operation, pebble crusher and gravity concentration, followed by a carbon-in-leach recovery process.

Again, the slats collected the heavier ore, which was then further processed. For these early techniques, water was an essential part of the process. However, since gold was not always found next to streams, miners often had to get the water to where the gold was, and thus elaborate networks of mining ditches were built throughout the gold

A reasonable grinding process is determined by the three most important factors: the hardness of the gold ore, the gold ore inlay, and the requirements for the particle size of the grinding product. The grinding process of the CIP gold processing plant is the same as that of the non-ferrous metal ore. There are also one and two stages of grinding.
