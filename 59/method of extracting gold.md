## How To Separate Copper From Gold - Realonomics
Gold and silver are often extracted together from the same ores or recovered as by-products from the extraction of other metals. A solid mixture of the two known as bullion or doré can be parted by boiling in nitric acid.  This is the most common method to purify gold. In this method strong acids are used as a means of dissolving impurities
