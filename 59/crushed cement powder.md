## How Cement Is Made
These ingredients, when heated at high temperatures form a rock-like substance that is ground into the fine powder that we commonly think of as cement.  After quarrying the rock is crushed. This involves several stages. The first crushing reduces the rock to a maximum size of about 6 inches. The rock then goes to secondary crushers or hammer

## Concrete vs Cement: What's The Difference? | Howden
To make concrete a mixture of portland cement (10-15%) and water (15-20%) make a paste. This paste is then mixed with aggregates (65-75%) such as sand and gravel, or crushed stone. As the cement and water mix, they harden and bind the aggregates into an impenetrable rock-like mass. Therefore: Cement + Aggregates + Water = Concrete.

When clinker is crushed into powder, gypsum or limestone is added to create cement. All these ingredients have to be mined and brought together at a plant.  The final product is stored in silos as cement. Cement powder is so fine that 1 pound of cement can contain 150 billion grains.

For example, you can replace 30% of portland cement and 100% of aggregates with glass powder and glass aggregate, respectively. In doing this, you won't encounter any ASR distress. The strength of concrete containing glass powder as a cement replacement material is approximately equal to that of concrete containing only portland cement.

NO. Concrete is a building material, and if used for its originally intended purpose, it is not a waste material at all.
