## Jaw Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
For coarse crushing application (closed set~300 mm), capacities range up to ca. 1,200 t h −1. However, Lewis et al. (1976) estimated that the economic advantage of using a jaw crusher over a gyratory diminishes at crushing rates above 545 t h −1, and above 725 t h −1 jaw crushers cannot compete.
