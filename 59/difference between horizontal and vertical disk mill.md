## CNC Machines for Horizontal vs Vertical Milling
Oct 26, 2020The horizontal milling machine is a type of machine tool with a spindle parallel to the worktable It is most often used to make various planes, inclined planes, and grooves with cylindrical milling cutters, disc cutters, angle cutters, forming cutters, end mills, and more. Horizontal milling machines do not use a fixed spindle.
