Impurities in Iron Ores There are certain impurities that lower the value of iron ores or may even make them valueless. Sulphur in the ore goes partly into the iron and steel and makes them brittle. While it is possible by roasting the ore and by other means to remove the sulphur, the presence of any considerable amount is objectionable.

## Archaeometallurgical slag
The ores used in ancient smelting processes were rarely pure metal compounds. Impurities were removed from the ore through the process of slagging, which involves adding heat and chemicals. Slag is the material in which the impurities from ores (known as gangue), as well as furnace lining and charcoal ash, collect. The study of slag can reveal information about the smelting process used at the

## Characterisation of phosphorus and other impurities in goethite-rich 
Impurities 1. Introduction Australia's iron ore industry is undergoing a major transformation. Reserves of traditional high-grade ores are becoming depleted while the replacement ore types are lower in grade and sometimes require beneficiation to remove or minimise contaminants such as alumina, silica and phosphorus ( Dukino et al., 2000 ).

## Why is limestone added as a flux to furnance when smelting metal ores?
Iron smelting was first developed by Sub-Saharan Africans independently around 2000BC. This is 800 years before it first appeared in the Eastern Mediterranean among the Hittites. This means when Sub-Saharan Africans were smelting Iron, and using Iron tools, most of Europe and the Middle East were still using an inferior technology of bronze.

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted. There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red.

The rest is impurities that require energy to remove them in the iron making process. The main impurities in iron ore are silica and alumina, which have to be melted out in the blast furnace to make slag with coke made from expensive coking coal. Water (often indicated by loss on ignition, or LOI) and phosphorus are also particularly important.

## Iron
Iron ( / ˈaɪərn /) is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26. It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table. It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, right in front of oxygen (32.1% and 30.1%, respectively), forming much of Earth's outer and inner core.

Singapore — Penalties for alumina and silica content in iron ore have soared since January this year, due to a resurgence in the supply of ores with higher impurities and a subsequent lackluster response in demand.

The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron. Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel. Steel is used to make automobiles, locomotives, ships, beams used in buildings, furniture, paper clips, tools, reinforcing rods for concrete, bicycles, and thousands of other items. It is the most-used metal by both tonnage and purpose.
