## The Role of Aggregates and Sands in The Construction Industry
The three main groups of coarse aggregates are: Igneous rocks - Andesite, basalt, dolerite, felsite, gabbro, granite, granodiorite, norite, rhyolite and syenite. Metamorphic rocks - Granite-gneiss, granulite, hornfels, quartzite and slate. 2 Sedimentary rocks - Quartzite, sandstone, greywacke, shale and tillite.

## What is Aggregate Supply? - Definition | Meaning | Example
Let's look at an example. Example. Manufacturing firms supply 100 tons of a particular good when the production costs total to $376,000. If the production costs rise to $581,000, these firms will be required to lower the supply of this particular good because the general price level of the economy will rise. At the same time, the labor costs total up to $30,500.

THE SHORT-RUN AGGREGATE SUPPLY CURVE. In the short run, a fall in the price level from P1 to P2 reduces the quantity of output supplied from Y1 to Y2. This positive relationship could be due to misperceptions, sticky wages, or sticky prices. Over time, perceptions, wages, and prices adjust, so this positive relationship is only temporary.

Distinguishing supply shocks from demand shocks has long been a goal of empirical macroeconomics (e.g., Shapiro and Watson, 1988, Blanchard and Quah, 1989, or Gali, 1992), in part because the appropriate monetary and scal policy responses may be quite di erent for adverse demand versus supply shocks.

Aggregate supply is the relationship between the overall price level in the economy and the amount of output that will be supplied. As output goes up, prices will be higher. We draw attention to factors that shift the aggregate supply curve. An adverse supply shock, such as a bad harvest, will cause supply to contract, raising prices and

South Africa inarguably has the most mature aggregates market in the region, kept under the watchful eye of the Aggregate and Sand Producers of Southern Africa (Aspasa) and the regulation of the country's Department of Mineral Resources (DMR). The DMR lists a total of 701 quarrying operations, 580 of which are aggregates and natural sand quarries.
