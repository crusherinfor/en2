Well, shales tend to break into thin, angular pieces whereas limestones tend to break into hard blocks. While mudstones also break into blocky pieces, they tend to be quite soft.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

limestone, sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), usually in the form of calcite or aragonite. It may contain considerable amounts of magnesium carbonate (dolomite) as well; minor constituents also commonly present include clay, iron carbonate, feldspar, pyrite, and quartz. Most limestones have a granular texture. Their constituent grains range in size from 0.001 mm (0.

## Iron-oxide concretions and nodules | Some Meteorite Information 
Hematite and magnetite are two common iron-oxide minerals. Most iron ore deposits consist mainly of hematite, magnetite, or both. Iron-oxide concretions, iron-oxide nodules, and ironstones are often mistaken for meteorites because they are heavy (dense) and their unusual (frequently bizarre!) shapes catch people's attention.
