## Manganese: Nodules, Uses, Facts, Ore, Alloys, Metal - Geology
Elemental manganese readily combines with oxygen, carbon, and silicon to form a long list of manganese minerals. Manganese ores generally contain 25 to 45 percent manganese, mostly in oxide (or hydroxide) and carbonate minerals. Manganese ores are widespread, but most of the world's supply is from a small number of manganese mining districts.
