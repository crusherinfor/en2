Rigid core flooring is an engineered vinyl floor that has enhanced construction for durability and stability. A rigid core will be a solid plank with less pliability, and provides more strength when installed underfoot. It's an improved version of the traditional vinyl flooring you may have grown up with. Think of it as marrying vinyl and. Vinyl flooring is a durable and resilient flooring

Limestone is calcium carbonate mined from the ground and crushed for various end uses. When high calcium limestone is burned or calcined in a lime kiln, quicklime (calcium oxide) is produced. Quicklime can then be reacted with water to produce hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide). Quicklime has a much higher available calcium carbonate equivalent

## A Look Into Carving Limestone
Wet the Stone. Limestone is formed in water, and wetting it makes it more malleable. It may be more prone to breakage, which is good for carving but can be detrimental to the overall shape. Check for cracks in your stone prior to wetting it, as those cracks indicate where pieces could break off when wet or being carved.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
