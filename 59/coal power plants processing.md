The coal that goes to a typical coal-fired power plant has minimal processing. It is crushed to approximately 5 cm in size before it is loaded into the inlet hopper. Coal contains many impurities. Coal in the midwest typically contains a lot of sulfur. The pyritic sulfur, from the mineral FeS, is relatively easy to remove.

##  Power Generation from Coal - Stanford University
Coal is the biggest single source of energy for electricity production and its share is growing. The efficiency of converting coal into electricity matters: more efficient power plants use less fuel and emit less climate-damaging carbon dioxide. This book explores how efficiency is measured and reported at coal-fired power plants.
