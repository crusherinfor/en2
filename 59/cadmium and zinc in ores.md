named it "cadmium" after cadmeia, the ancient Greek name for zinc ore. It was first used as yellow cadmium sulfide paint pigment later in the 19th century. The first commercial cadmium metal was produced in Germany in the 1880s as a byproduct of the smelt ing of zinc ores from Upper Silesia (now part of Poland).

## cadmium and zinc in ores
Feb 3, 2021Cadmium is an element. Its most abundant naturally-occurring isotope is non-radioactive. It is found in nature in mineral forms and is obtained for commercial uses principally from cadmium ore, called greenockite, which is commonly found in association with zinc ore. Commercial production of cadmium ore depends on the mining of zinc (ATSDR 1999).

Zinc-to-cadmium ratios in typical zinc ores range from 200:1 to 400:1. Sphalerite (ZnS), the most economically significant zinc mineral, commonly contains minor amounts of other elements; cadmium, which shares certain similar chemical properties with zinc, will often substitute for zinc in the sphalerite crystal lattice.

Cadmium is a rare metal. The concentration of cadmium on the Earth is around 0.5 ppm (parts per million). Mostly it is present in the form of ores of zinc and sulfide. The sulfide ore of cadmium is termed as greenockite (CdS). Currently, cadmium is obtained from the mining, smelting and purification of ores of zinc sulfide, and copper sulfide.

## cadmium and zinc in ores
 Cadmium is found in nature at low concentrations, mainly with the sulfide ores of zinc, lead, and copper. Cadmium ores are not abundant, but Cd may be found in most zinc ores given its isomorphic substitution to zinc. However, due to its widespread occurrence, cadmium is found in measurable amounts in food, drink, and breath [1,25].
