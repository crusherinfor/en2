## What are the differences between calcium bentonite clay and  - Quora
Answer (1 of 2): Sodium bentonite clay is used on your skin and hair. It contains high levels of sulfur, which is why it is so good for your hair and skin. It is also full of nutrients, which is why it is so good for your skin. This is also why it is used in natural beauty products. It is what gi

into foundry practice in recent years, the green-sand moulding in bentonite mixture still remains the most widely used technology. Higher utility properties of bentonite binders are achieved through their activation. This contribu-tion is aimed at finding a suitable activating agent. A number of sodium salts and MgO based agents has been chosen.

## Food grade bentonite claysche-schule
There's two different types of bentonite clay that is available. There's one that is safe for consumption and the other being industrial purposes. Naturally, you should know that consuming the industrial grade bentonite is extremely dangerous. Stick to the food grade bentonite and you will be fine. Bentonite clay has a lot of similar uses.

## Calcium Bentonite Vs Sodium Bentonite In Clay Bodies
Apparently calcium bentonite is often used in foundrys for its combination of plasticity and favourable green strength compared to sodium bentonite. Calcium bentonite might also have a helpful chemistry (or not!) for the clay body, which starts to become relevant when you are adding potentially 10% or 12% rather than 2% or 3% as a raw material.
