## sedimentary rock - Origin of limestones | Britannica
Origin of limestones Limestones originate mainly through the lithification of loose carbonate sediments. Modern carbonate sediments are generated in a variety of environments: continental, marine, and transitional, but most are marine. The present-day Bahama banks is the best known modern carbonate setting.

##  Indiana Limestone Institute of America, Inc.
Indiana Limestone (geologically known as the Salem Limestone) is essentially a monomineralic rock con-sisting of the calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) mineral named calcite. The calcite comes from the skeletal material (about 75 percent) that form the framework grains and from the cementing material (about 20 per-cent) that binds the grains together.

## How Limestone is Formed
Limestone Formation Limestone is any rock that is made mostly from calcium carbonate, but there are several types. It forms with carbonate rocks were deposited in seawater and continue to form as coral reefs in shallow seas. Marine limestone comes together when seawater with high concentrations of chemicals as they dissolve.

## Limestone
Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes, though biological processes, such as the accumulation of corals and shells in the sea, have likely been more important for the last 540 million years.

## Anatomy of the grainstone shoal facies of the Salem Limestone 
Shoal facies of the Salem Limestone in south-central Indiana are composed of (1) bryozoan- and echinoderm-rich (85-95%) grainstones, and (3) foraminiferal-echinodermal grainstones. Microfacies and bedform analyses indicate that deposition took place under tidal conditions where sporadic storm events mobilized the entire sand body.

Because the name Bedford stone had come to dominate the building-stone industry, the Salem was first formally named the Bedford Oolitic Limestone (Hopkins and Siebenthal, 1897). The formation was renamed the Salem Limestone by Cumings in 1901 because the name Bedford was preoccupied by the Bedford Shale of Ohio (Newberry, 1871).
