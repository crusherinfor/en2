## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

Conversion — Iron- and carbon-rich fines, dust and wet sludge converted to high-quality feedstock. Mixing — Connects fine carbon particles to iron oxides for improved reduction. Binder — Less binder for more high-value metallics and carbon recovery. Sizing — Our dies ensure precise sizing, from 10-150mm, for most smelting processes.

## Influencing Factors of the Mineral Carbonation Process of Iron Ore 
Mining waste may contain potential minerals that can act as essential feedstock for long-term carbon sequestration through a mineral carbonation process. This study attempts to identify the mineralogical and chemical composition of iron ore mining waste alongside the effects of particle size, temperature, and pH on carbonation efficiency. The samples were found to be alkaline in nature (pH of

## UG-Mat Mineral Processing Wastes | Recycled Materials Resource Center
Waste rock from iron ore processing is usually either trap rock or granite, which makes an excellent source of aggregate. Mill Tailings Mill tailings have successfully been used as aggregate in asphalt paving applications. Generally, the coarser, sand-size fractions of mill tailings can also be considered for use as coarse aggregates provided
