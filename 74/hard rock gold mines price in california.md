## Early Mining History of Grass Valley, California
The first official town election was held in 1850, and in 1860, the town of Grass Valley incorporated. Mining and logging were by far the mainstays of Nevada County's economy. Grass Valley was literally circled by mines running 24/7, 365 days per year. However, the history of town was not without its rough times.

Gold State Icon - California State Mineral - State legislation signed on April 23, 1965 designated native gold as California's official state mineral. At the signing ceremony, Governor Edmund G. Brown said, "selection of gold as our state mineral is acknowledgement of the intimate part it has played in the history of our people and of the fact that mining is a major California economic activity."

## Hard Rock Mining: The process | Wells Historical Society
The fixed price of gold in 1934 increased from $20.67 U.S. to $35 U.S. per troy ounce and remained fixed at $35 USD until 1968. Initially the jump made gold mining a great venture in the 1930s, but the fixed price eventually discouraged mining because increasing inflation over the same period decreased the profits to the companies.
