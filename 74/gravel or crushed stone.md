Tests have also shown that steel slag is an equally good substitute for gravel or crushed stone aggregate in both stabilised cement and unbound base layers. Properties of a cement-stabilised mixture of slag, natural crushed stone, and 0.7% and 2% of cement (Class 42.5 N) meet the compressive strength criteria set by Croatian standards [27].
