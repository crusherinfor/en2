Rip the sheet of 3/4 inch plywood down to 12-inch (30.5 cm) wide x 48-inch (1.2 m) long strips. This will give you 8 bricks per strip, and the entire sheet of plywood will give you a total of 64 bricks. Cut the side forms down to 2 x 4 inches (5.1 x 10.2 cm). You will need 2 pieces at 48 inches (1.2 m) long for each strip.

At the final stage, cement is packaged into bags and ready to produce concrete. The first step in the process of making concrete is mixing cement, water, sand and gravel in the proportion of 15%, 10%, 25% and 50% respectively. This mixture is then put into a concrete mixer to produce concrete, which is used for building purposes.
