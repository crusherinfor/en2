## Mapping and Assessment of the Economic Impact of Small-Scale  - IISTE
Mapping and analysis of alluvial gold concentrations as well as assessment of the impact of mining activities on the people of Talensi-Nabdam District, Ghana was undertaken. The mining concessions allocated to small-scale miners were surveyed and mapped using Total Station and Electrometric distance measurement equipment.

## Integrated Assessment of Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining in Ghana 
This paper is one of three synthesis documents produced via an integrated assessment (IA) that aims to increase understanding of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in Ghana. Given the complexities surrounding ASGM, an integrated assessment (IA) framework was utilized to analyze socio-economic, health, and environmental data, and co-develop evidence-based responses with stakeholders.
