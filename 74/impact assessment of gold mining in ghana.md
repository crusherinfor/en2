## Mapping and Assessment of the Economic Impact of Small-Scale  - IISTE
Mapping and analysis of alluvial gold concentrations as well as assessment of the impact of mining activities on the people of Talensi-Nabdam District, Ghana was undertaken. The mining concessions allocated to small-scale miners were surveyed and mapped using Total Station and Electrometric distance measurement equipment.
