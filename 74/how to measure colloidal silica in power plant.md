## Silica (SiO2) - Water Chemistry
Silica, in the colloidal form, can be removed by a RO but it can cause colloidal fouling of the front-end of a RO. Colloidal silica, with sizes as small as 0.008 micron can be measured empirically by the SDI (Silt Density Index) test, but only that portion that is larger than 0.45 micron or larger.

## Surface modification for stability of nano-sized silica colloids
Abstract. The surfaces of commercial 30-nm colloidal silica particles were modified by reacting with functional silanes. The high specific surface area and reactivity of the particles due to the small size make the process susceptible to irreversible aggregation not found previously with larger particles. This study compares surface charge
