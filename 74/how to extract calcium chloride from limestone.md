Robert makes an excellent point here! Just try soaking a hard boiled egg in vinegar overnight. This will extract all of the calcium from the shell (1 shell is about 2000mg calcium). The vinegar causes the carbonate to be separated from the calcium. The carbonate evaporates as bubbles, and the calcium is left in the vinegar.

## Calcium Chloride | Puracy Ingredients
Calcium chloride occurs naturally in limestone and is primarily a reaction of limestone with hydrochloric acid, calcium, or chloride salts. [4] It is often commercially produced as a byproduct in the soda ash process (called the Solvay process). [1] In United States, many manufacturers concentrate brines from salt lakes and salt deposits.
