## Best place to mine/bank iron ore? : r/2007scape - reddit
cjbeastly • 7 yr. ago. South of varrock there's an iron mine, get a full invent and walk back up to the West Bank or maybe ardougne with tele tabs. It's rather inefficient to mine and bank iron as the iron is near worthless and the xp rates with banking are god awful.

Japan in particular found it easier politically to import iron ore from Portuguese Goa instead of British India. By the time of liberation in 1961, some 800 mining concessions had been granted. This early mining was highly manual. Pundalik Naik's Acchev ("The Upheaval") describes this period very well. Mining used pickaxes and shovels.
