The cooled dore bars are secured in the refinery safe and the slag is fed manually into the ball mill for reprocessing. The production rate of the EXAMPLE Gold Mines processing plant is expected to be approximately 4000 troy ounces of combined gold and silver (dore) per day. Each refining day will produce 8-1000 troy ounce dore bars.

Rocks with large concentrations of minerals, are called ores. Mining depends on finding good quality ore, preferably within a small area. The next step is to get the rocks which contain the mineral out of the ground. Once the ore is on the surface, the process of getting the mineral you want out of the rock can start.
