Re-beneficiation of iron ore tailings from the conventional beneficiation plants The hematite ore (Fe 2 O 3) is always associated with limonite & goethite ores, which cannot be attracted by high gauss magnetic separators in the conventional beneficiation plants. Such tailings have 30-50% left-over Fe, which is a waste of natural resources.

Coal is a great source of energy gifted by the nature. Main hazard in the use of coal is the production of sulphur oxides, sulphur dioxides, and nitrogen oxides which affect the climate severely. To protect environment from these hazardous oxides of sulphur, clean coal technology is being introduced and applied all over the world.

## A Beneficiation Study on a Low Grade Iron Ore by Gravity and Magnetic 
In this paper, a sample from Tange-zagh iron mine was characterized by gravity and magnetic separation methods. The mineralogical studies showed that hematite and goethite are the main iron-bearing minerals with insignificant amounts of FeO. The results indicated that spiral separation yields higher separation efficiency than others. The combination of spiral and multi gravity methods showed
