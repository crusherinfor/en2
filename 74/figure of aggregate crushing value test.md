Quarried stone is a crushed aggregate of various sizes suitable for construction, driveways, patios, french drains and even erosion control. Commonly referred to as " Blue Stone" we supply various sizes as described below. #57 is the most common size for top coating existing driveways.It averages 3/4-1 in. size and is a clean stone without dust.

The base layer of a gravel driveway should be much larger than the gravel you'll use for the middle and top layers. Base gravel is typically #1 crushed stone, where pieces are angular and close to the size of baseballs. The base layer gives the middle and top layers a foundation they can somewhat settle down into rather than washing away.
