The base layer of a gravel driveway should be much larger than the gravel you'll use for the middle and top layers. Base gravel is typically #1 crushed stone, where pieces are angular and close to the size of baseballs. The base layer gives the middle and top layers a foundation they can somewhat settle down into rather than washing away.
