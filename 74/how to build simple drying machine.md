## Simple Machine Projects for Kids - Thimble Online STEM Classes
Simple machine projects for kids are possible at a surprisingly early age. Preschool kids can build ramps, levers to launch stuffed animals, and observe simple machines in their everyday life. Engineering projects can start as soon as you want them to, and believe us when we say "The earlier, the better!".
