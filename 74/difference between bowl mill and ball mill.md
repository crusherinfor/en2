## Ball Mills vs Rod Mills - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Rods in place weigh approximately 400 pounds per cu. ft. and balls in place approximately 300 pounds per cu. ft.. Thus, quantitatively, less material can progress through the voids in the rod mill grinding media than in the ball mill, and the path of the material is more confined. This grinding action restricts the volume of feed which passes

## Difference and Choice of 2 Common Mills, Ball Mill and Grinding Mill - FTM
Ball mills are different. The grinding media is unfixed steel ball, etc., which produces larger sized powder than grinding mill. the size of the discharged product can mainly be adjusted between 40-250 mesh. If the size of discharged product is uneven, it is needed to equip a powder separating machine.
