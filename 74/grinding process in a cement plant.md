## Efficient grinding unit selection impacts profitability - Indian Cement 
Therefore, producing cement with less energy is becoming a key element of profitability: as the grinding process consumes about 60 per cent of the total plant electrical energy demand and about 20 per cent of cement production variable cost. So efficient grinding unit selection impacts profitability of cement manufacturing.

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules, usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.
