Gold Extraction an overview ScienceDirect Topics. The effect of pH value on gold extraction for various ore types is shown in Figure 28.4. Greatly increasing pH value has a beneficial effect on gold extraction for both oxide and sulfide ores and stabilizes ∼pH 9.5-10.0, whereas for some carbonaceous ores, pH value has no apparent effect.

Carbonaceous minerals can lock up gold in a similar manner to sulfide minerals. Carbon containing minerals also introduce another problem with gold extraction. Even if the gold is essentially free in a carbon containing ore, when cyanide is used for gold extraction, the carbon can cause preg-robbing.

More than 85% of the gold can be extracted from ore with solutions containing 15 g/L glycine at pH 12.5 in 336 h. The presence of ferric ions did not improve the gold extraction, and most of the ferric has been precipitated from the leach solutions, implying that the chosen ferric complex was not sufficiently stable at the operating pH.

## Gold extraction
Gold extraction or recovery from its ores may require a combination of comminution, mineral processing, hydrometallurgical, and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore. Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing, resulting in direct recovery of small gold nuggets and flakes.

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.
