offers us a helpful way of thinking about bias. Imagine bias as a metaphorical conveyor belt, like the ones at the airport that move people from one terminal to the next. Imagine that the conveyor belt represents all of the influences around us - messages that shape and reinforce our biases about how different people are.

The main function of the guide idler is it does not allow the conveyor belt to go out of frame. So that guide idler helps to prevent damage of conveyor belt. Return idler: It is used at the lower end of the conveyor belt. It supports the lower portion of the conveyor belt. You can find it in 1.5 meters to 2-meter distance in the conveyor system.

This is why noise consideration of conveyor belts by the end user is essential. A partnership must exist between the supplier of the conveyor and its end user so as to effectively manage the problem of noise control. This way issues such a installation and the design of the conveyor can be well addressed by the conveyor supplier. Posted in:

## How Does a Conveyor Belt Work? • Con Belt
The Movement of a Conveyor Belt. As a rotor turns, the conveyor belt will turn as well due to the intense friction between the rotor wheel and the belt. This turning motion of the rotor causes one side of the belt to move in one direction, while the other moves in the opposite direction. This means that both wheels must always be moving in

How do conveyor systems work. Typically conveyor systems consist of a belt stretched across two or more pulleys. The belt forms a closed loop around the pulleys so it can continually rotate. One pulley known as the drive pulley drives or tows the belt moving items from one location to another. How do roller conveyor belts work?
