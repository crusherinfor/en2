## Pretreatment of South African sugarcane bagasse using a low-cost protic 
The bagasse preparations obtained in order of decreasing particle size were long fiber bagasse (LFB), short fiber bagasse (SFB) and pith bagasse (PB). Each of the three fractions was further ground with a cutting mill (sieve size 1 mm) and sieved (0.18-0.85 mm, US mesh scale − 20/+ 80) and stored air dry in sealed plastic bags at ambient

For all above reasons, glass recycle is done by glass crushing machine. The glass crusher machine is designed in such a way that it will be used with minimum power consumption, small size with less cost and blade is designed in such a way that with lesser impact force and high speed of rotation of blade causes reduction in particle size.

The best condition of the bagasse particle size was for 0.08 mm. For this case, a great quantity of cellulose (78.8 %) was converted into glucose. Optical absorption spectroscopy was applied to determine ozone concentrations in real time where the samples with typical bagasse particle sizes equal or below to 0.5 mm had shown a better absorption

Aug 6, 2022For different particle size groups, the crushing degree of the 2-5 mm particle size group is greater under the same confining pressure and relative density. Larger particles are more vulnerable to crushing because they contain more internal flaws and the surface shapes are more irregular. Overall, the particle crushing degree of volcanic soil

Laser diffraction has become one of the most commonly used particle sizing methods, especially for particles in the range of 0.5 to 1000 microns.
