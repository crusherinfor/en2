## Is Tidal Energy Renewable? A Complete Answer - Linquip
Tidal energy is the most reliable source of renewable energy because of the continuous change in tidal movements that occur twice a day from the moon's gravitational force. Tidal energy runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Besides, It does not require any use of nonrenewable resources, such as oil, to power the technology.

Nov 1, 2020Tidal energy is a renewable source of energy that comes from changing sea levels. The tide of the sea changes levels from high to low and from low to high, creating a sort of energy that has the potential to be used for different purposes. One of the great things about tide is that it's constant and almost predictable.

TIDAL POWER. HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT. Mills powered by tidal energy have been known along the coasts of Brittany, France, since the 12th century. Much later, American colonists built tidal-powered mills in New England. The early tidal mills used the great mechanical force of the tides to turn waterwheels connected to grindstones.

Tidal power is a known green energy source, at least in terms of emitting zero greenhouse gases. It also doesn't take up that much space.  Water has one thousand times higher density than air and tidal turbines can generate electricity at speeds as low as 1m/s, or 2.2mph. In contrast, most wind turbines begin generating electricity at 3m/s

## Tidal power - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
Aug 10, 2022In some places, tides cause water levels near the shore to rise and fall up to 40 feet. People in Europe harnessed this movement of water to operate grain mills more than a 1,000 years ago. Today, there are tidal energy systems that generate electricity. Producing tidal energy economically requires a tidal range of at least 10 feet.

## Tidal Barrage - WAVE and TIDAL ENERGY CONVERTERS
Tidal barrage is a form of tidal energy conversion, which converts energy from tidal flows into electrical energy. Tidal energy has many advantages compared with other forms of renewable energy. The main advantage is that tidal motion is well-understood, especially in coastal areas, and thus tidal predictions have a high degree of accuracy.

## Tidal power
Tidal power or tidal energy is harnessed by converting energy from tides into useful forms of power, mainly electricity using various methods.. Although not yet widely used, tidal energy has the potential for future electricity generation.Tides are more predictable than the wind and the sun.Among sources of renewable energy, tidal energy has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and

## Is Tidal Power a Viable Source of Energy?
Tidal turbines are arranged underwater in rows like wind turbines. These turbines can work best in regions where the coastal currents run between 4 and 5.5 mph. With currents of that speed, a 15-m diameter tidal turbine is capable of producing energy equivalent to that of a 60-m diameter wind turbine.

The tidal power plant at the Rance River estuary in Brittany, France, uses a barrage. It was built in 1966 and is still functioning. The plant uses two sources of energy: tidal energy from the English Channel and river current energy from the Rance River. The barrage has led to an increased level of silt in the habitat.
