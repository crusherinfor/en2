## Iron ore mining and dressing - tec-science
Ore processing (or ore dressing) is the separation of iron ore from gangue in order to optimize the blast furnace process! In principle, the undesirable gangue can never be completely separated from the iron ores during ore dressing. This means that a certain amount of unwanted elements always enters the blast furnace process.

## Principle Of Iron Ore Processing At Vale
Principle Of Iron Ore Processing At Vale - Grinding Mill China. In iron ore mining, miner usually choose a complete iron ore crushing plant for metallurgy. Iron ore beneficiation process. Almost all of the iron ore that is mined is used for making steel. So we need the extraction of a pure metal from its ore.

## Iron Ore Principle
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore in order to extract a base metal.It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.
