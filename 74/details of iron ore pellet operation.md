Iron ore crushing is now mostly done in iron ore processing workshops and in self-braking and semi-self-breaking Asian countries instead of classical Asia (rod-pellet). In autochthonous Asians, the extracted stones enter autochthonous Asia directly after the first stage of crushing, and the coarse grains crush other particles as they break down.

## The Iron Pelletizing Process: Part One :: Total Materia Article
The pelletizing process is a process which contains numerous sub-processes, or process segments. On the way from the mine to a final product, the iron ore goes through the following main process segments: 1) The iron ore is crushed and the waste rock is removed. About 85 % of the particles should be less than 44 μm (in length, width, or height).

## Fine Dry Grinding of Iron Ore for Pelletizing
When dry grinding is selected the moisture required for pelletizing must be provided either by wetting the ore and mixing prior to balling or by adding all the moisture in the balling device. To date only the balling disc has operated with a dry feed. Based on power consumed per ton of final product, generally the power consumption in the
