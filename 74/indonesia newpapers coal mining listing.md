By producing 535Mt of coal, Indonesia stood as the world's fourth-largest coal producer in 2020. The production fell by 13% in 2020 over 2019, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, which subdued coal demand both from domestic and exports markets. This has led the companies to reduce their guidance for the year.
