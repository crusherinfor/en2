## Gyratory Crushers - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Primary gyratory crushers are designated by two numbers. These are the size of the feed opening (in inches) and the diameter of the mantle at its base (in inches). A 60″~x~89″ crusher would have an opening dimension of 60 inches (152 cm) and a diameter across the base of the mantle of 89 inches (226 cm).

The Sandvik CH cone crusher can be calibrated to achieve specific results, maximize productivity and minimize wear, but any calculation will be undermined without a solid understanding of what is going in to the crusher. Sampling is a vital part of the crushing process, to ensure that you know the size distribution of the feed.

Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis.  A Jaw Crusher reduces large size rocks or ore by placing the rock into compression. A fixed jaw, mounted in a "V" alignment is the stationary
