## Gypsum Plaster and Cement Plaster Comparison - Oyester Homes
The application of cement plaster is time-consuming process hence increases the project cost. However, per square feet cost of cement plaster is less than gypsum plaster due to higher cost of gypsum. Gypsum Plaster: In gypsum plaster, gypsum is used as a binding material instead of Portland cement. It does not need sand and is ready to use.

## What is the purpose of adding gypsum in cement?
Gypsum is a mineral and is hydrated calcium sulfate in chemical form. Gypsum plays a very important role in controlling the rate of hardening of the cement. During the cement manufacturing process, upon the cooling of clinker, a small amount of gypsum is introduced during the final grinding process. Gypsum is added to control the

## What metal is in concrete?
The main purpose of adding gypsum in the cement is to slow down the hydration rate of cement once it is mixed with water. The hydrates formed by the interaction of water and cement during the curing process create an expansive force that can crack the concrete. By adding gypsum, the hydration process is slowed and the expansive force is limited.

Cement is made by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) with small quantities of other minerals such as clay to 1450°C in a kiln, in a process known as calcination. The resulting hard substance, called 'clinker', is then ground with a small amount of gypsum into a powder to make 'Ordinary Portland Cement', the most commonly used type

If there is no gypsum in the cement, the concrete will set quickly in the mixing process, resulting in the failure of stirring and construction. The reason why fast setting occurs in the cement without gypsum after mixing with water is mainly because the C 3 A in the clinker dissolves rapidly in water and quickly forms calcium aluminate hydrate
