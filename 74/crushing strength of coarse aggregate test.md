Grades of concrete are defined by the strength and composition of the concrete, and the minimum strength the concrete should have following 28 days of initial construction. The grade of concrete is understood in measurements of MPa, where M stands for mix and the MPa denotes the overall strength .  6525 psi : High Strength Concrete Grades: M50.

Procedure for crushing strength of aggregate. Before testing, the aggregate should be in surface dry condition.You can achieve the dry condition of aggregate by placing aggregates in an oven for 4 hours at 100-degree Celcius. The aggregates passing through 12.5mm and retained on 10mm IS sieves are selected for finding aggregate crushing strength.

Aggregate Crushing value test IS Code is 2386-4 (1963): Methods of Test for Aggregates for Concrete

## Standard of Crushing Value of Coarse Aggregates for Permeable  - Hindawi
7. Effect of Pressure on the Crushing Value of Coarse Aggregate. The greater the pressure on aggregate, the easier it will be crushed. When the crushing test of coarse aggregates is carried out, the contact stress between coarse aggregates should be consistent with the actual contact stress between coarse aggregates in actual pavement.
