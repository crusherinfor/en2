## Surface Grinding Machines and Process - Engineers Edge
Surface Grinding is a manufacturing process which moves or grinding wheel relative a surface in a plane while a grinding wheel contacts the surface and removes a minute amount of material, such that a flat surface is created. The term surface grinding designates any process which accurately processes or grinds a surface.

Grinding. Grinding is a machining process used to improve surface finish, cut hard materials, and tighten the tolerance on flat and cylindrical part surfaces by removing a very small amount of material. While the grinding process has been vastly improved upon with the addition of CNC, it is still a very slow way to remove stock from a part.
