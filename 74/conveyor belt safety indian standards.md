## Guarding Slide Presentation: Guarding Conveyor Belts at Metal and 
This slide presentation, compiled in 2010, provides detailed information to help the metal and nonmetal mining industry meet MSHA's requirements for guarding conveyor belts. Photos of a variety of situations show the right and wrong ways to construct guards that protect miners from exposure to conveyor belt moving parts and satisfy MSHA regulations.

## Safeguarding the Hazards Presented by Conveyors - Procter Machine Safety
Most hazards associated with conveyors relate to the nip points, which can easily draw in clothing, tools, loose hair, fingers or limbs, depending on the size, speed and power of the conveyor. The standards, such as BS and BS EN 620, highlight where nip points typically exist, but be aware that reversible belt conveyors need nip points
