Type (1) is done in an ore deposit where some of the ore is left behind to form columns in the mine that prevents it from collapsing and it is used for coal mining.

In surface mining, the ground covering the coal seam (the overburden) is first removed to expose the coal seam for extraction. The elements of a surface mining operation are (1) topsoil removal and storage for later use, (2) drilling and blasting the strata overlying the coal seam, (3) loading and transporting this fragmented overburden material (called spoil), (4) drilling and blasting the

## Coal and coal mining - Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand
Europeans began mining coal in New Zealand in the 1840s. At first, men went underground and dug out the coal with picks and shovels. In the early 1900s men used explosives and compressed-air machines in mines to cut coal from the seam. The coal was loaded into wagons and taken out of the mine. From the 1990s high-pressure water jets were used

Various methods of surface and underground mining of coal. Mining of coal seams is achieved in several different ways. "Strip" mines remove any top soil with bulldozers to get at coal near the earth's surface. "Drift" mines angle horizontally into a mountainside and may be very shallow (i.e., not tall enough for a person to stand up in).

The highest coal recovery is normally achieved when retreat mining is combined with room-and-pillar mining. This method is often referred to as room-and-pillar with retreat mining. Retreat mining is a systematic removal of coal support pillars once a mining section has been developed using standard room-and-pillar mining.

Longwall mining. Longwall mining is a type of caving, applied to a horizontal tabular deposit such as coal. While block and sublevel caving are essentially vertically advancing metal mining methods, longwall mining is applied to relatively thin and flat-lying deposits - most often coal, but occasionally an industrial mineral such as trona.

In India coal seams with inclination as steep as 1 in 3 have been worked by mechanised opencast mining methods in Karanpura field. Seams at shallow depths which are actively gassy, liable to spontaneous heating or with bad roof should preferably be extracted by quarrying as the mining legislation for underground working of such seams is stringent.

Early Mining Methods History of Coal Mining HouseFuel. Bell pit mining was one of the early methods of underground mining. The name comes from the shape that the mine forms. A long narrow shaft is dug down until it reaches the coal seam. Once it reaches the seam, the coal is then mined laterally along the seam either side of the shaft

Prior to the 18th century, Aboriginal people and early colonists used coal for casual burning and trade. They relied on exposed surface deposits, such as the Joggins Fossil Cliffs in Nova Scotia. Coal was first exploited by underground mining methods in Cape Breton in 1720, with the French Port Morien mine supplying the fortress of Louisbourg

The black, oily coal buried under about 200 feet of sandstone was accessed through deep mining and suited for fueling steam locomotives. This workforce helped the area become the industrial center of the state. Coal companies created communities for the workers near mining locations. Some were temporary camps with dirt roads and shacks.

Bord and pillar mining. This diagram shows the traditional method of bord and pillar mining. Miners extracted coal along roadways or bords, with the coal between the bords acting as pillars holding up the roof. The outer pillars were then mined, leaving the roof to collapse in a controlled way as the miners retreated towards the exit.
