## Separating iron from blood - Chemistry Stack Exchange
2 Answers. It is not possible to separate iron from blood without damaging the haemoglobin. Iron is a part of haemoglobin, and if iron is removed, the haemoglobin becomes something else. The blood then becomes incapable of transferring oxygen. Using the reactivity series, just displace the iron with a more reactive metal.

Yes, it is possible to extract iron from sand or from some rocks. To do so you have two really good options. You can use Black Sand or Iron Ore. First, let's concentrate on sand. Typically dark grey or blackish sand will have higher iron content than whiter sand. Dark brown sand doesn't mean there will be more iron than white sand.

Iron Extraction. The common ores of iron are its oxide, hematite, Fe 2 O 3, and magnetite, Fe 3 O 4. They can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. The coke burns in an exothermic reaction. At the high temperatures, the carbon dioxide reacts with more coke to make carbon monoxide.
