## Magnetic Separation - Principles and Application in Beneficiation of 
Magnetic Separation is one of the physical concentration processes that utilizes the differences in magnetic properties of various minerals present in the ore body. The magnetic fraction may be valuable or gangue depending upon its end use in a particular process and so also the non-magnetic fraction, e.g., separation of magnetite (magnetic) from quartz (non-magnetic), separation of tin

## USA - Process for beneficiating magnetite iron ore - Google
A process for upgrading low-grade magnetite-containing iron ore with minimum fine grinding. The dry ore is first comminuted to between about three-fourths inch and 10 mesh particle size and magnetically separated. The dry tailing is discarded and the concentrate is ground to between about 20 and 100 mesh and again subjected to dry magnetic separation.

Secondly, the basis of magnetic separation is that pyrite is more magnetic than coal and/or can be partially converted into more magnetic compounds of iron upon treatment. Thus any separation or treatment can best be followed by magnetic susceptibility measurements which give a measure of force of separation.

## beneficiation of iron ore in magnetic separation
iron ores process for magnetic separatoriron ores uses in industry. Magnetic separation and iron ore beneficiation ispatguru oct magnetic separator separates the iron ore feed material into two or more components if the purpose is to produce a magnetic concentrated iron ore then the other component which is nonmagnetic is the tailings in some cases there can also be a possibility of separating
