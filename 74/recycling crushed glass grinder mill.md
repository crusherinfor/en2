Shredded Paper Recycling Process. Shredded paper is classified as mixed paper, so the first step in recycling is to separate it from cardboard, office paper and newspaper grades. Shredded paper is then baled and sent to a mill. At the mill, there are machines called pulpers that introduce water and chemicals to break down the paper into fibers.
