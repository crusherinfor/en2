Bauxite Bauxite is a sedimentary rock with a relatively high aluminium content. It is the world's main source of aluminium. Bauxite consists mostly of the aluminium minerals gibbsite, boehmite and diaspore, mixed with the two iron oxides goethite and haematite, the aluminium clay mineral kaolinite and small amounts of anatase and ilmenite.

Bauxite has also seen growing use as a proppant in recent years. Proppants are used in the hydraulic fracturing process to "prop" open rock fissures allowing natural gas or oil to flow out. Bauxite is sintered in a rotary kiln in order to harden the material so that it can withstand the extreme pressures it will be subjected to.
