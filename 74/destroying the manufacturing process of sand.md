Sand casting is the most common method used for metal casting. It is manufacturing process at least three thousand years old: the first evidence of clay casting comes out of China, during the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 to 1046 BC). It is no wonder this process is still so popular: sand is cheap, plentiful, pliable, and able to take the heat.

The modern casting process is subdivided into two main categories: expendable and non-expendable (Permanent) casting. When the mould is used for single casting, it is made of sand. Such moulds are called expandable moulds since they are destroyed while making out of casting. These are used for the production of smaller quantities.

Nov 30, 2020The use of manufactured sand makes sense from various perspectives. First, manufactured sand is more uniform in structure compared with natural sand. It also has an advantage when it comes to concrete production, because manufactured sand is less needed in the concrete mix by a margin of 5 to 20% compared with natural sand to fill the voids
