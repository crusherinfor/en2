## Manufacturing washing machines using polymer particles to clean clothes
Polymer particles can be reused in 100 washes before being recycled, helping to reduce 47% of power consumption while reducing more than 72% of water using conventional washing. Xeros has an exterior design similar to other standard washing machines. The name Xeros of the upper washing machine generation comes from the Greek word, meaning 'dry'.

## How do I get rid of black particles in washing machine?
Measure out two cups of distilled white vinegar and pour it directly into your washing machine's detergent dispenser. Set the washer to run on its longest cycle with the hottest water. Sprinkle half a cup of baking soda directly into the drum of the washing machine and run it on the same settings (highest and hottest).

Dewatering of Coal-Clay Waste. In the preparation of coal to produce low-ash material, a waste product containing fine coal and clay is generated. This waste product, generally minus 23 mesh in size with the major portion being minus 325 mesh, is difficult to handle owing to the slow settling of the fine-sized clay particles.

An equivalent total depth of 42 ft of clays averaging 3.5% solids content were added, through a 308-day period, to the 7-ft pit. The final thickness of the clay bodies was 42 in, and the clay solids averaged 33.8%. The design of the experiment was aimed at creating a 400- to 600-lb/ft² pressure on the clay wastes.

## Why and how to capture microfibers from washing machine
Latest research suggests a cubic meter of ocean water contains over 8 million plastic particles.  Textiles release microfibers while being worn, carried over, and especially during washing in a washing machine. A washing machine literally beats up the clothing. It spins at more than 1000 rounds per minute with frequent starts and stops.

## Clay
Clay is a type of fine-grained natural soil material containing clay minerals. Clays develop plasticity when wet, due to a molecular film of water surrounding the clay particles, but become hard, brittle and non-plastic upon drying or firing. Most pure clay minerals are white or light-coloured, but natural clays show a variety of colours from impurities, such as a reddish or brownish colour
