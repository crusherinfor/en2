## Effects of Carbon Thin Film on Low-Heat Cement Hydration, Temperature 
Research on the mechanism of carbon thin film (CTF) is a hot issue in the field of concrete materials and is of great significance to the temperature control and crack prevention of concrete structures, but little research has been conducted regarding this issue. In this paper, the composition of CTF and its influence on cement hydration, concrete temperature and strength are studied in the

## Hydration Characteristics of Low-Heat Cement Substituted by Fly  - MDPI
This study proposed a new binder as an alternative to conventional cement to reduce the heat of hydration in mass concrete elements. As a main cementitious material, low-heat cement (LHC) was considered, and then fly ash (FA), modified FA (MFA) by vibrator mill, and limestone powder (LP) were used as a partial replacement of LHC. The addition of FA delayed the induction period at the hydration

4) Low Heat Cement: Low heat cement is made when the proportion of C2S is increased and C3S and C3A are decreased in content. This creates low heat of hydration. It's a less reactive cement while the initial time it takes to set is greater than OPC. This type of cement is generally used in mass concrete construction like gravity dams.
