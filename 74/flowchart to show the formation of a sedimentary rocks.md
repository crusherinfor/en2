Compaction is the compression of the sediments under overlying weight of sediments. Cementation is the process of filling in the gaps in sediments, with minerals that gel them together. Crystal formation may occur here too. With these two processes at work, what was a loose layer of deposits, hardens and solidifies to become rock.

Rock Flow Chart by Dean Nguyen on Prezi. Sedimentary rocks begin when wind or rain break off pieces of rock and then the rocks are then transported to the bottom of mountains or the bottom of oceans. The deposited rock then sits there for over thousands and thousands of years. Each deposited rock is in its own layer.
