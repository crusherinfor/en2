Bronze has a higher melting point (315 - 1080 °C) than brass (809 - 1030 °C) and they are both easily cast. The melting point of brass and bronze is very important and crucial for the selection of either bronze or brass for a project. This is because there can be a component failure at the melting point.

A propane torch can be a successful heat source, and an added bonus is that it will melt the gold within a few minutes. To use a torch, place the gold into a crucible, place the crucible on a surface that withstands heat, and point your propane torch toward the gold. Add chemical borax to the gold first if you need it to melt at lower temperatures.

## How to Recover Fine Gold in Sand
Seek out darker sands that have a higher composition of hematite, magnetite, and the other black sands. This is where the gold is hiding. You will find that black sands will form in layers and bands within the sand. Digging a hole straight down will often show that there are several different pay layers.

## Can You Extract Gold from Black Sand? - Reclaim, Recycle, and Sell your 
The answer is, it depends on the kind of black sand that you have - if it does contain gold. If gold is present in small nuggets or flakes that are not physically bound to minerals, they can sometimes be separated by sifting or using a device called a shaker table or other specialized machinery.

## Melting gold concentrate without flux - Pyrometallurgy: Roasting 
You probably can melt gold concentrate if it is reasonably pure. Typically a flux is added to even re-melting gold bullion to reduce volatilisation and if it is in a finely divided form the lower melting point flux as a liquid provides better heat transfer to the solids. In its most basic form a borax cover is often all that is used.

## Using Borax Flux to Refine Gold - Manhattan Gold & Silver
With some borax, heat, and a little know-how, it's possible to extract pure gold from a sample of ore. This is because using borax as the flux reduces the melting point of all the elements in a piece of ore, including gold. While out in the field, a gold prospector can grind and wash a piece of ore, then mix it with borax in a plastic bag.
