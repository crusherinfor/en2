Tin mining tailings could contain commercial quantities of rare earths both US and China would be keen to tap. by John McBeth September 9, 2020. China controls as much as 80% of the world's rare earth mineral supply. Image: Facebook. JAKARTA - Rare earth, the experts like to say, is neither rare nor is it earth.

Apr 20, 2021The mining and refining of rare earths, as in most mining of resources, has environmental tradeoffs.This includes piles of tailings that can create landslides and concentrate hazardous waste, the potential for groundwater contamination, and the CO 2 footprint — although EVs are starting to be developed for mining purposes — the potential for radiation exposure, and more.

In the 1990s, a number of successful Chinese mining operations began, with their rich supply of high-quality rare earths flooding the global market and driving prices down to near-record lows. The same phenomenon that lured the United States into the rare earths business — rapid price fluctuation — ushered their exit as well.
