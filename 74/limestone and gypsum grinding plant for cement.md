## Influence of limestone content, gypsum content and  - ScienceDirect
This paper examines the behavior of Portland limestone cements (PLCs) made by inter-grinding clinker, gypsum and limestone in a full size-cement plant, while varying the content of limestone filler (LF - 0% and 24%), content of gypsum (GC - 2.5% and 5.0%) and PLC fineness, measured as that fraction retained on a 45 μm sieve (R45 - 5% and 18%).
