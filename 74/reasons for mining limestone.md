## The Importance of Limestone
Limestone is a naturally forming mineral that is found in various amount on every continent. The Ancient Romans were among the first to use it as a building material, recognizing its aesthetic quality, and strength. It turns out, though, that limestone has more than just a pretty face to offer - its variety of uses make everything that it

## How to Remove Limestone Stain Efficiently and Easily
Apply the cleaner thoroughly to every part of the stain until it is gone. After you're done removing stains from a limestone floor, you need to rinse the floor with warm water. Doing so will prevent any stickiness from being left over by the cleaner. Then, dry the floors and voila, a job well done!

As noted earlier, mining can cause severe, long-term environmental damage, which can be injurious to health and livelihoods. The negative externalities of mining need to be understood, minimised and carefully managed so that local communities are not left to fend for themselves, especially once the mining boom is over and mines have closed.
