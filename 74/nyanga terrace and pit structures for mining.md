Written by Anne Kritzinger, the booklet is a populist version of research that she carried out in the Nyanga region. In one breath, Kritzinger not only dismisses the dwarf cattle theory and irrigable terraced fields claim, she advances a very plausible gold mining explanation. And in the process, she has stirred a hornet's nest.

## Nyanga archaeology - no evidence to support mining activity
The current interpretation of pit structures as cattle pens (e.g. Garlake, 1966; Soper, 2000) places them at the centre of settlements. This has been demonstrated by the identification of hut circles, wall residues and other features at numerous pit structure sites, such as the reconstructed site near Nyanga (Rhodes) Dam.
