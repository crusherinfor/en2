The aggregate crushing value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. With aggregate of aggregate crushing value 30 or higher, the result may be anomalous, and in such cases the ten percent fines value should be determined instead.

The aggregate crushing strength value is a useful factor to know the behavior of aggregates when subjected to compressive loads. Impact Value The aggregate impact value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to sudden shock or impact. The impact value of an aggregate is sometime used as an alternative to its crushing value.

The aggregate crushing value provides a subjective measure of the resistance of the aggregate crushing in the pressure of the progressively smeared compressive load. When the aggregate crushing value is 30 or greater the outcome can be irregular and in those kind of circumstances the ten percent fines value has to be assessed in its place.

So this aggregate was not strong. 4 CONCLUSION. The ACV value is more than 45% for aggregate used for concrete for non- wearing surface and less than 25% for wearing surface like runways and roadways.

## Standard of Crushing Value of Coarse Aggregates for Permeable  - Hindawi
The crushing values of two different lithologic coarse aggregates were measured under different pressures, 400 kN or 600 kN, respectively. The crushing value criterion of coarse aggregates used in the PA mixture was suggested to be no greater than 16% after comparative analysis.

## How to Determine the Aggregate Crushing Strength Value in  - ReadCivil
The aggregate crushing value is defined as the ratio of the weight of fines passing through specified IS (here 2.36mm sieve) to the total weight of sample expressed in percentage. W1= Weigh of the total aggregates (Wa-We) W2= Weigh of aggregates passing through 2.36mm IS sieve. Aggregate crushing value= ( W2 / W1 ) × 100
