## How Limestone is Formed
Limestone has a lot of different industrial uses and can be mined and processed for those reasons as a raw material. It can also be used in agriculture, the environment and many other areas. As little as 10 years ago, crushed limestone was about 68% of all crushed rock produced within the country. It is prevalent in places you wouldn't even

To make slaked lime you need three things, crushed limestone, a source of heat (wood) and water. When limestone is heated to high temperatures (around 1000 degrees c )in an oxygen rich atmosphere it breaks down into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. This CaO is also known as quicklime and is an extremely strong base.

Limestone Raises the Effectiveness of Some Herbicides. The structure of the soil in your field or garden improves with the addition of limestone to correct the soil's pH level. Due to this improvement, nutrients are better absorbed, and your plants can retain more water. Additionally, herbicides work more efficiently in a neutral pH-based

Calcination of CaCO3 is a highly endothermic reaction, requiring around 755 Mcal of heat input to produce a ton of lime (CaO). The reaction only begins when the temperature is above the dissociation temperature of the carbonates in the limestone. This typically is between 780 deg C and 1340 deg C.

## Limestone's Reaction With Hydrochloric Acid - 922 Words | 123 Help Me
quickly the reaction between the CaCO3 and the HCl takes place. I predict that the stronger the acid is, and the warmer the air is, the faster the limestone will react with the hydrochloric acid. This. prediction is based mainly upon the collision theory, for this states. that as substances heat up, the molecules and the atoms move around.

## Calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid
Calcium Carbonate + Hydrochloric Acid Calcium Chloride + Water + Carbon Dioxide. CaCO3 + 2HCl CaCl2 + H2O + CO2. The rate of reaction is a measure of how quickly a reaction happens. In this instance, we are timing how long it takes for our reaction to produce 50cm3 of carbon dioxide. For chemists synthesizing chemicals, working out the rate of.

## The Origin of Limestone - In the Beginning: Compelling Evidence for 
Limestone, sometimes called calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ), is difficult to identify by sight, but is quickly identified by the "acid test." If a drop of any acid, such as vinegar, is placed on limestone or a rock containing limestone, it will fizz. The acid combines with the limestone to release fizzing bubbles of CO 2 gas.
