## Conveyor belt system: structure and 3 common types
The conveyor belt system's standard structure has three layers: a top cover, carcass, and bottom cover. However, some applications require multiple layers of the conveyor belt. The layers of the belt depending on the products that you want to move. Steel, aramid, polyester, nylon, and cotton are some most common carcass layer's materials.

## Design of Belt conveyor system - SlideShare
The diameter of the pulley must be designed such that it does not place undue stress on the belt. The length of a belt conveyor in metres is the length from the centre of pulley parallel to belt line. Belt length is dependent on both the pulley diameters and centre distances. Capacity is the product of speed and belt cross sectional area.

## The Complete Guide to Industrial Conveyor Selection, Configuration, and 
The chart above illustrates the distance/length requirement for the level of incline on an inclined conveyor. In addition to a lower profile, the "L" and "S" configurations of the steep incline conveyor allow it to replace multiple pieces of handling equipment; one S-type steep incline conveyor can replace two belt conveyors and a bucket elevator, significantly reducing the overall
