## Iron ore
Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines. Magnetite. Magnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and

## Iron Ore Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel, which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. The seven largest of these producing countries

Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## Dry beneficiation of iron ore - Mineral Processing
The haematite ore in South Africa is processed in a dry process to a HQ lump ore with 64 % iron content and a sintered fine ore with 63.5 % iron content. For fine ore beneficiation, wet processes are used. Capacity at the Minas Rio is to be increased from 26.5 Mta capacity to 28 Mta in the forthcoming years.

##  Australia's Bulk Commodity Giants - Minerals Council of Australia
The majority of iron ore (more than 70 per cent) trades in the seaborne market, with relatively small volumes being produced and consumed domestically.1 China is by far the largest importer of iron ore, representing more than two-thirds of total world trade in iron ore.2 Japan, the country which initiated the development of the
