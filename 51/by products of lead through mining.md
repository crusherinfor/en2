How Is Lead Mined? Lead is extracted from ores dug from under-ground mines. .Next the lead powder is put through a flotation process that involves mixing the lead ore with water the addition of pine oil and the introduction of air bubbles and agitation which forms an oil froth containing the lead ore on the surface.

A strong recovery in lead mining output from the Covid-19 pandemic will persist over . We forecast lead mine production to reverse most of the sustained declines since 2013 by 2030. Output will be boosted by increased investment into copper, zinc and silver mines that produce lead as a by-product. Lead mine production will grow most rapidly in Peru and Australia.

## Lead Mining Market Report | Global Forecast From 2022 To 2030 - Dataintelo
Lead mining is the extraction of lead ore from mines. Lead ores can be mined through underground or open-pit methods, depending upon their depth below the surface and breadth of deposit. The primary method to extract it is smelting, which is a chemical reaction between ore and high temperature in order to separate metallic components.
