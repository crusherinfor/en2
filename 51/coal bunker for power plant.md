## Power Generation and Bunker C Fuel - Bell Performance
Power generation plants in the United States have historically relied on three main fuels - coal, natural gas, and heavy fuel oil (also called #6 bunker C fuel oil).Coal and fuel oil were dominant fuels for power generation in past decades, but more recently, there has been a real shift with natural gas cutting into fuel oil's share of the generation market.

The initial process in coal based thermal power plant is coal handling.The Function of coal Handling Plant in thermal power plant is to receive, process, store, feed the coal bunkers consistently over entire life of the power plant. Coal is transported in thermal power station either by railways,roadways or rope ways.

The coal from the coal bunkers is allowed to flow down into the boiler room through two rows of downtakes, one on each side of the central gangway or firing place. Each bunker has eight cast-iron outlets, four on each side, and to these outlets are bolted gate valves for shutting off the coal from the corresponding downtakes.

## Calculation of coal handling plant and bunker capacity
Buker capacity is generally designed for 12-14 hours of full load operation. Let us calculate with 12 hours of operation hours. Coal consumption in 12 hours = 392 X 12 /24 =196 MT. Volume of bunker = 196 X 1000/800 = 245 M3. Take 10% of extra margin on bunker as some of coal stucked on bunker wall surface cannot be used for Boiler.
