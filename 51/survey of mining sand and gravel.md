Sand and gravel are widely used throughout the U.S. construction industry, but their extraction can significantly affect the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of mined streams. Fisheries biologists often find themselves involved in the complex environmental and regulatory issues related to instream sand and gravel mining.

## Sand and Gravel - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Sand and gravel are key components for a number of industries—especially construction and coastal protection/restoration—and are major marine extractable resources. The commercial mining of gravel, sand, and related minerals (Baker et al., 2014) is generally restricted to shallow waters within national EEZs.
