## Unearthing Indonesia's 10 Biggest Coal Oligarchs - Project Multatuli
In Indonesia, coal has long been exploited to satisfy the avarice of those in power. Prior to the country's independence, in 1861, the Dutch colonial government began mining coal in Palaran, East Kalimantan, before kicking off production in Ombilin, West Sumatra, in 1892. In fact, Kalimantan and Sumatra islands are Indonesia's 'supermarket' of coal. As of 2020, coal reserves on the two islands

Geothermal energy is the thermal energy in the Earth's crust which originates from the formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions.
