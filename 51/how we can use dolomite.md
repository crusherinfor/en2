## What is so wrong about dolomite lime in coco? | International 
Member. Feb 9, 2009. #17. You can use dolomite lime with coco, but its very dangerous if you add more than required. Being dolomite of slow release, you may find a huge lock out due excess Ca, that is the worst ever it may happen when growing in coco. Coco need a Ca/mg buffering.

## Dolomite: The mineral dolomite information and pictures
Dolomite is a very common mineral, and is known for its saddle-shaped curved crystal aggregates. A unique, isolated Dolomite occurrence in Eugui, Spain has provided colorless transparent crystals that resemble the Iceland Spar variety of Calcite.The occurrence of Kolwezi, in the Congo, has produced some fascinating, cobalt-rich specimens that are a beautiful hot pink color and highly popular.

## Dolomite Countertop Pros and Cons - Countertop Advisor
Dolomite is a harder-than-average material and is not as fragile as marble. On the Mohs hardness scale, dolomite rates at 3.5 - 4, superior to marble's Mohs rating. A higher hardness rating makes it a durable and strong countertop over time, capable of supporting various uses while being resistant to wear and tear.

Dolomite as a ceramic material is a uniform calcium magnesium carbonate. In ceramic glazes, it is used as a source of magnesia and calcia. Other than talc, dolomite is the principal source of MgO in high-temperature raw glazes. 'Dolomite matte' stoneware glazes, for example, are highly prized for their pleasant 'silky' surface texture.

Most plants grow best at a pH of 6.0 to 7.4 - neutral. If the soil is lower than 5.9, dolomite lime can be used to elevate the pH so that it is a bit more alkaline and amenable to healthy plant growth. While neutral soil is preferred by most plants, soil pH occasionally can veer more into the acidic or more alkaline territory.

## Dolomite - Complete Mineral Overview
Dolomite is an anhydrous carbonate mineral composed of nominally equal parts calcium and magnesium, with the formula CaMg (CO 3) 2. Its chemical formula can be more clearly written as CaCO 3 .MgCO 3. Because of the presence of two various cations, which form regular layers inside dolomite structure, dolomite crystal symmetry is lower than calcite.

Transparent dolomite crystals are difficult for faceters to cut. Dolomites have a low and variable hardness of 3.5 to 4, which varies along its four crystal axes, as well as perfect cleavage. These factors also make it a fragile stone for jewelry use. They are more liable to scratch and break than most jewelry stones.

## Dolomite Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
Dolomite also serves as an oil and gas reservoir rock. During the conversion of calcite to dolomite, a volume reduction occurs. This can produce pore spaces in the rock that can be filled with oil or natural gas that migrate in as they are released from other rock units. This makes the dolomite a reservoir rock and a target of oil and gas drilling.
