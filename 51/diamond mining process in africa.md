Pipe mining is like the process for mining coal underground. The "blueground" (a term used to describe the earth in which diamonds are formed) is crushed and flushed with water as it moves on conveyor belts through tubes. Once the diamond-bearing matter is washed, it is dropped onto greased belts. Diamonds stick to the grease; other matter

Entrepreneur Cecil Rhodes established De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited 22 years later, in 1888. By 1900, De Beers, through its mines in South Africa, controlled an estimated 90 percent of the world

While some diamonds are mined in Canada and Russia, the great majority are found in Africa, where they're sourced from both deep-earth mines and alluvial beds. Wherever they're found, each diamond takes millions of years to form and requires extensive resources—both equipment and manpower—and time to discover.

The result of this careless mining is severe damage to the environment surrounding the diamond mines. Usable water is already scarce in Africa, but irresponsible, unregulated mining for blood diamonds makes it even harder to find. Unlike other forms of mining, diamond mining uses water to extract the diamonds as opposed to chemicals.
