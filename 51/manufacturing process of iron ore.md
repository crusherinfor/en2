## Iron Ore Processing Plant With 50 Years Experiences
The HIsarna steelmaking process is a process of primary steelmaking in which iron ore is processed almost directly into steel. The process is based on a new type of blast furnace called a Cyclone Converter Furnace, which makes it possible to skip the process of manufacturing pig iron pellets, a necessary step in the basic oxygen steelmaking

This smelting process melts out and separates iron from the original rock material. Iron ore is mixed with coke, a form of very pure coal. The blast furnace burns the coke to heat the iron ore causing it to react into iron (Fe 2), nitrogen (N 2), and carbon dioxide (CO 2). This iron is often known as "pig iron" or "hot metal" as it is a liquid

## The Six Main Steps of Iron Ore Processing | Multotec Canada
When the iron ore is extracted from the mine, it must undergo several processing stages. Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening. We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing.

Casting is the process of pouring the iron into a mold thus giving it a shape. Molds and pouring methods divide this process up. Molds can be made as expendable molds (sand) or non-expendable molds (metal). Pouring can happen via gravity, low-pressure or vacuum. Controlling the pouring process becomes more important the more intricate the mold is.
