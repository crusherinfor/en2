## Aggregates - Cement
Aggregates strongly influence concrete's freshly mixed and hardened properties, mixture proportions, and economy. Consequently, selection of aggregates is an important process. Although some variation in aggregate properties is expected, characteristics that are considered include: grading; durability; particle shape and surface texture

## What Is Grading Of Aggregates? And Its Limits [Civil Planets]
The grading of aggregates is the determination of the aggregate size used for construction works. The coarse aggregate is graded as per its size (10mm, 12mm & 20mm). The selection of the right coarse aggregate size depends on the specific construction activity. You will understand how grading of aggregates influences the bondage in concrete

This effectively sets grading limits for fine aggregates. The grading zone of fine aggregates is limited to those with a finenesss modulus of between 2.30 and 3.10. A high fineness modulus generally indicates that the aggregate is deficient in smaller particles. Fine aggregate gradings with higher fineness modulus values are also cost effective

## A machine vision approach to the grading of crushed aggregate
The grading of crushed aggregate is carried out usually by sieving. We describe a new image-based approach to the automatic grading of such materials. The operational problem addressed is where the camera is located directly over a conveyor belt. Our approach characterizes the information content of each image, taking into account relative variation in the pixel data, and resolution scale. In
