## Melting of sugar physical or chemical
Explanation: The chemical reaction we are most familiar with is that of melting : sugar decomposes at a temperature ranging between 184 and 186°C. This is a very recent discovery we owe to a team of researchers in Illinois. Basically, when we heat sucrose gently, this produces a phenomenon known as " apparent melting ".
