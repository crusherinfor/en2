## Feldspar vs Quartz: What Are They, And What's The Difference?
Feldspar has two perfect cleavages which meet at a 90-degree angle, which means that when feldspar is hit with a geologist's hammer, the pieces will always look the same. In contrast, quartz has indiscernible cleavage. When quartz is hit with a geologist's hammer, the pieces will all be random and break into different sizes and shapes. Appearance

## Quartz or Feldspar? Which mineral should I date? - The Glow Curve
Both quartz and feldspar are commonly used for luminescence dating. Which mineral is dated depends on its abundance in the sample, as well as its luminescence characteristics. Feldspar exists as a range of mineral species, but the one most commonly used in luminescence studies is potassium (K-) feldspar.

Man-made quartz does not need sealing because of the way it is made. Quartzite, on the other hand, is less prone to scratching and can also withstand heat slightly better than quartz . When it comes to costs, quartzite is generally slightly more expensive than quartz because it needs to be cut into slabs to meet the specifications of each.
