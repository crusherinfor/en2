## How to Select the Right Vibratory Feeder | powderbulksolids
There are two basic designs available when selecting a vibrating feeder: electromagnetic and electromechanical. A third option—air-powered vibrating feeders—are basically an alternate to electromechanical feeders since they have the same simple brute force design concept—the vibratory drive is directly attached to the tray.

## Reducing Vibration Transfer Through Balancing and Isolation
This is a combination method of mounting a conveyor using a balanced counterweight on top of a weighted base which is then mounted on isolation springs. The counterweight absorbs most of the vibration reaction, but the weighted base and isolation springs continue to absorb further remaining reactions, allowing this method to reduce vibrations

Thus the magnet produces a vibrating frequency of 100 cycles, which is necessary for smooth & reliable movement of small & light weight workpieces. Some vibratory Feeder manufacturers use 50 Cycles / HALF WAVE Bowl Feeders too. Thus a linear vibratory feeder consists of a tray or track mounted on a base by inclined leaf springs or packs of springs.
