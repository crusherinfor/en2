## Chlorine dioxide
Chlorine dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula ClO 2 that exists as yellowish-green gas above 11 °C, a reddish-brown liquid between 11 °C and −59 °C, and as bright orange crystals below −59 °C. It does not hydrolyze when it enters water, and is usually handled as an aqueous solution. Potential hazards with chlorine dioxide include poisoning and the risk of spontaneous

With ClimateHero CO2 calculator you can calculate your co2e emissions in just 5 minutes.  CO2 is the chemical writing for carbon dioxide, while e refers to equivalent . Sometimes it is written as CO2ekv. The CO2 impact in the atmosphere is measured in parts per million (ppm). Since 2017 the co2 intensity in the atmosphere is above 400 ppm.

## Manganese Dioxide - Water Filter Advisor
Manganese dioxide works as a catalyst to improve water quality by removing iron and manganese, and other contaminants in tap water from municipal water supplies and deep well. MnO2 is responsible for the chemical reactions occurring inside the filter system to remove iron, manganese, radium, arsenic, and hydrogen sulfide from the water source.

## Manganese metal is extracted from manganese dioxide by a reduction 
1 Answer Alternative - (d) Aluminium, is the correct answer. Explanation : Manganese metal is extracted from manganese dioxide by using aluminium a reducing agent. Some metals cannot easily reduce with carbon and hence aluminium used.

## The Magic of Manganese Dioxide: What It Is and Why You Should Care
Manganese dioxide creates a catalytic effect in the chemical oxidation-reduction reactions necessary to remove iron, manganese, H2S, arsenic and radium. Manganese dioxide's catalytic reaction allows iron and manganese that are not oxidized to catalytically precipitate and be adsorbed directly onto MnO2-based media.3.

## Manganese Dioxide - Chemical, Physical Properties, Solved  - VEDANTU
Manganese dioxide here acts as a catalyst and accelerates the reaction. 2H2O2(aq) → 2H2O (l) + O2(g) Here manganese dioxide is the accelerant. When manganese dioxide is added to hydrogen peroxide, bubbles of oxygen are produced. 3MnO2 (s) + 4Al (s) → 3Mn (I) + 2Al2O3 (s) Manganese Dioxide Reacting With Potassium Chlorate

## Frontiers | Rapid Preparation of Manganese Monoxide by Microwave 
Most of the manganese resources in China have existed in the form of low-grade pyrolusite which is not utilized efficiently because of the high energy consumption and environmental pollution during the reduction process. Applying microwave heating to minerals reduction endows improved production efficiency and reduced production costs. In the present work, rapid preparation of manganese
