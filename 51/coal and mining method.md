## Which method of extracting coal is safer for miners?
Score: 5/5 (10 votes) . Longwall mining accounts for 50 percent of coal mines in the world and is much safer than other methods of coal mining. If done right, the process is much more profitable as resource recovery is dramatically improved (about 80 percent compared with about 60 percent for room-and-pillar).

## Different Methods of Mining Coal - Going offshore
The primary underground mining ways are Continuous, Longwall, Shortwall, Retreat and Blast Mining. Longwall mining method is adopted for about 50% of underground mining. This method involves a complex machine with a revolving drum that sways mechanically back and forth across the coal deposit. This method yields high production and ensures safety.

## Underground Coal Mining Methods
Underground Coal Mining Methods. Underground coal mining mainly include the process of drift, slope, and shaft mining, and actual mining methods include longwall and room and pillar mining. Drift Mines enter the side of a hill horizontally and mine the coal within the hill. Slope mines usually begin in a valley bottom, and a tunnel slopes down

## Longwall mining
Longwall mining. Longwall mining is a form of underground coal mining where a long wall of coal is mined in a single slice (typically 0.6-1.0 m (2 ft 0 in - 3 ft 3 in) thick). The longwall panel (the block of coal that is being mined) is typically 3-4 km (1.9-2.5 mi) long and m (820-1,310 ft) wide.

## Coal explained Coal prices and outlook - Energy Information Administration
The price of coal varies by coal rank and grade, mining method, and geographic region. Coal is classified into four main ranks—lignite, subbituminous, bituminous, and anthracite—depending on the amounts and types of carbon it contains and the amount of heat energy it can produce. Prices are generally higher for coal with high heat content.

Here we'll examine traditional and novel mining techniques. The American Geosciences web site defines four main mining methods: underground, open surface (pit), placer, and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.

Breast stoping refers to the working of a flat orebody, or a flat section of an orebody, just as coal is mined from a flat coal seam. That is, a slice is worked in a horizontal direction. The assumption is that there is no open stope either above or below the slice

## Open-pit Mining, Opencast Mining, Open-cut Mining, Strip Mining, Mining 
The most economical method of extracting coal depends upon the depth and the quality of the coal seams. Coals are mined both from surface and underground. Contour mining is associated with coal. This bed of coal is located at an elevation in a mountain range or any other hilly area. It is a method of strip or surface mining.

Coal-mining employment increased rapidly in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and peaked in 1923 at 798,000. Since then, the number of miners has fallen considerably since, due to mechanization.

Starting in the 1960s coal seams in both Kentucky coal fields have been increasingly accessed via a method known as Mountaintop Removal Mining, which is a form of surface mining that involves the topographical alteration and/or removal of a summit, summit ridge, or significant portion of a mountain, hill, or ridge in order to obtain a desired geologic material.

Surface mining and, deep underground mining are the two basic methods adopted for mining coal. The, choice of mining method depends primarily on depth of burial, density of the, overburden and thickness of the coal seam. Seams relatively close to the surface, at, depths less than approximately 180 ft (50 m), are usually surface mined.

## 7.3.2: Contour Mining | ABC 123: Testing Site / Course
Contour mining methods evolved to allow the economic extraction of coal using smaller and more agile equipment with more flexible mining patterns. As with area mining, it is necessary to remove the vegetation and remove the overburden to gain access to the coal seam. There are two ways to handle the removed overburden: haul it all the way down

## Coal Mining - Methods of Extraction | Methods Extraction | Technology 
The most economical method of coal extraction from coal seams depends on the depth and quality of the seams, and the geology and environmental factors. Coal mining processes are differentiated by whether they operate on the surface or underground. Many coals extracted from both surface and underground mines require washing in a coal preparation
