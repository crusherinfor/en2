## Rolling of Metals: Process and Principles (With Diagram)
The rolling process is shown in Fig. 2.1: Rolling is done both hot and cold. It is accomplishes in rolling mills. A rolling mill is a complex machine having two or more working rollers, supporting rollers, roll stands, drive motor, reducing gear, flywheel, coupling gear etc. Rollers may be plain or grooved depends upon the shape of rolled product.

## Manufacturing Process - TCRSS
Cold rolling causes steel to become hard and brittle. To obtain the desired microstructure and improve mechanical properties, the cold rolled strip is annealed at the suitable temperatures. TCRSS employs 100% Hydrogen atmosphere annealing facilities. Coils can achieve homogeneous qualities and higher production rate due to higher heat transfer.

The cold rolled coil is made of hot rolled coil. In cold rolled process, the hot rolled coil is rolled below the recrystallization temperature, and the generally rolled steel is rolled at room temperature. Steel sheet with high silicon content has low brittleness and low plasticity, and needs to be preheated to 200 °C before cold rolling.

Chromium and nickel give stainless steel its stain resistance and attribute to the hardness of the metal. This added hardness increases the amount of force needed to place a bend on a stainless steel sheet. As you bend a stainless steel sheet the bend area cold hardens, increasing the amount of pressure required to finish the bend.

## Hot and Cold: Flat Rolled Steel Properties and Uses - Hascall Steel
Flat-rolled steel products consist of two kinds, namely, hot rolled sheets and cold rolled sheets. They are manufactured differently, each having its particular application. Hot Rolled Steel. Hot rolled steel is turned into a coil of steel while the temperature is above 1700 degrees Fahrenheit. This process makes the material more malleable

## How is Steel Made? Steel Production Process (With PDF)
Steel Manufacturing Process. To produce steel first the iron ore is heated and melted in a furnace. The impurities are then removed from the molten iron. Carbon and other required alloying elements are added to make steel. Modern-day steel making is highly improved and specialized.

## How to Produce Steel Plates? The Steel Plates Manufacturing Process!
Cold rolled steel is essentially hot rolled steel that has had further processing. The steel is processed further in cold reduction mills, where the material is cooled (at room temperature) followed by annealing and/or tempers rolling. The cold rolled process creates a finished product that is more precise dimensionally than a hot rolled product.

In comparison a cold rolled steel product with the same chemical composition has a yield strength of 365 mpa. Thus the yield strength of cold rolled steel is higher than that of hot rolled steel. Cold rolling is a process by which the sheet metal or strip stock is introduced between rollers and then compressed and squeezed.
