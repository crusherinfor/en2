## How Long Do Monitors Last? [Computer Monitor Lifespan]
How long do monitors last? On average, a monitor that is used for about 8 hours a day should last from 30,000 to 60,000 hours. This is the equivalent of 10 to 20 years of service life. The factors that determine how long a monitor lasts include how often it is used and how well it is cared for. Monitors, especially LCDs, usually last a long time.

## Vibrating Screen Working Principle - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The simplest Vibrating Screen Working Principle can be explained using the single deck screen and put it onto an inclined frame. The frame is mounted on springs. The vibration is generated from an unbalanced flywheel. A very erratic motion is developed when this wheel is rotated.
