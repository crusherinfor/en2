## Coal - Types, Uses and Formation - VEDANTU
The rank of the coal deposit determines the amount of pressure and the heat that has acted on the dead and decayed matter over a prolonged period of time. Anthracite: It has the highest heating value of all the other coal types as it contains about 86-97% carbon. It summed up to less than 1% of the coal mined in the USA in the year 2020.

## Distribution of Coal in India: Gondwana Coalfields & Tertiary  - PMF IAS
Gondwana coal makes up to 98 per cent of the total reserves and 99 per cent of the production of coal in India. Satpuras, denudation [weathering + erosion] has exposed coal bearing Gondwana strata. The carbon content in Gondwana coal [250 million years old] is less compared to the Carboniferous coal [350 million years old] [Almost Absent in
