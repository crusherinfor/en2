Beneficiation is the process of increasing the concentration of a valuable component of an ore. Native iron particles exist in lunar soil in fairly large quantities. They come from nickel-iron meteorites, which become pulverized upon impact.These iron particles are tiny (fine grained) and well mixed into the fine dust of the lunar regolith.As they are in a metallic state and strongly magnetic

Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.
