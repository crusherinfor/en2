## Human, environmental costs of sand, gravel mining overlooked - study
A new study led by researchers at McGill University and the University of Copenhagen states that the human and environmental costs of sand and gravel extraction in lower and middle-income countries have, so far, been overlooked.. According to the scientists, sand and gravel are the most mined materials in the world, with between 32 and 50 billion tonnes extracted globally each year.
