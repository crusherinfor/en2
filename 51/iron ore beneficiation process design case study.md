There are usually 3 magnetite beneficiation methods: (1) Single weak magnetic separation. (2) Weak magnetic separation - reverse flotation. (3) Weak magnetic-strong magnetic-flotation combined process.

## Marillana Iron Ore Project: Feasibility studies - Ausenco English
Ausenco, as Lead Study Manager, assisted Brockman Resources to complete a prefeasibility study (PFS) for the project in 2009. The PFS was based on the mining and beneficiation of detritals and CID ore at a design plant throughput of 37.5 Mt/y, with a mine life in excess of 20 years at a nominal 18 Mt/y production.

## Iron Ore Beneficiation Process
Iron Ore Beneficiation Process. During the last ten years great strides have been made, on the Mesabi range, in the practice of beneficiating low grade iron ore material. By beneficiation is meant all methods of removing impurities, and raising the iron content to a point where it can be sold in open market, the principal impurities being
