## Glass
UK glass manufacturers prize clear glass - or flint - most highly because and while most glass made in the UK is clear, by far the largest proportion of the glass waste stream is green. For this reason green is prized the least. Completely mixed glass cannot directly be used in the container re-melt industry, where colour purity is vital
