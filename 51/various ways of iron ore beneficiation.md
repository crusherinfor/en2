The rate of reduction of both iron ore and quartz varies (Figures 1 to 3). Quartz dissipates easily, breaking down to fines with little applied stress. Though the hardness value of quartz (i.e. 7 on the Mohr's scale) is a bit higher than the iron ore (Hematite (5.5-6.5), Magnetite (5.5-6), it is far more brittle than iron ore (Gribble, 1988).

## A Trend ? A Necessity? Iron Ore Beneficiation - Blogger
Iron ore beneficiation uses the fact that the physical and chemical properties of the ore mineral and the impurities differ. All this is done to ensure that the plant waste doesn't contain more than 45 percent Fe. A circuit is designed making use of different methods depending on type and source of the ore. Different methods employed by most

## Beneficiation of Clay-Rich High-LOI Low-Grade Iron Ore Fines 
The unutilized iron ore fines (IOF, − 10 mm, 45% to < 60% Fe(T)) left at various mine sites during blasting and processing are rich in goethetic-hematite associated with high clay and considered a potential iron ore resource. The variation of loss on ignition (LOI) from mines to mines is based on the goethite and clay mineral content. The clay containing below 45 μm is mostly brittle
