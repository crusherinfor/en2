## Strip Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Mining includes modern, small-scale, and artisanal surface mining, strip mining, placer mining, underground mining, solution mining, in situ mining, quarrying, or the extraction of groundwater. Approximately 240,000 km 2 of the Earth's surface are covered by abandoned, closed, or orphaned mines ( Wolkersdorfer, 2008 ).

## Underground Mining vs. Surface Mining - Fucheng LHD
Surface mining. Surface mining（ground mining） is a type of mining in which the soil and rock covering the mineral deposit are removed instead of underground mining, in which the overlying stones are left in place. Surface miner machine（surface mining machines） is essential. The surface mining process is very complicated.

It has been estimated that more than two-thirds of the world's yearly mineral production is extracted by surface mining. Surface mining is the preference for mining companies because removing the terrain surface to access the mineral beneath is often more cost-effective than digging tunnels and shafts to access mineral resources underground

Underground mining, where miners tunnel beneath the Earth's surface to extract mineral deposits, is rarer than open-pit mining. In 2014, it made up about 5% of all American mining operations — and has less of an impact on the surface. However, this doesn't mean that underground mining doesn't have an effect on the environment.
