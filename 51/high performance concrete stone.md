1, The high viscosity of high-strength concrete results in poor fluidity and cannot meet the pumping requirements of super high-rise buildings, so it is easy to cause pipe blockage. 2, When the fluidity of concrete is too large, its anti-segregation and bleeding ability will decrease.

The creep coefficient of Ductal® is less than 0.8, and if a heat treatment is applied, the creep factor is less than 0.2, as shown in the figure below.
