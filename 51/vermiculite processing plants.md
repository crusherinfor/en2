Vermiculite is commonly used by those in the gardening trade to root cuttings. It can be used in various ways, either used alone, mixed with soil, or combined with bark for a soilless potting mixture. Whether used alone, or in a mix, propagating a cutting with vermiculite will promote anchorage for new roots, and speed up root growth.

The pre-growth of vegetable plants is a clean thing in vermiculite. Vermiculite stores moisture extremely well. You prefer to grow your plants in closed containers. The seedlings grow much more loosely in vermiculite than in soil and can be separated much better when it comes to pricking. This prevents root damage.
