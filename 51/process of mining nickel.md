## BioHeap - A Bioleaching Process for Nickel Extraction
Once a desired level of metal in solution has been achieved, a bleed stream is removed from the system and the dissolved metals removed using conventional precipitation, electrowinning and solvent extraction methods. By 22 weeks of operation, nickel recovery was 74%, well above the company's estimate of 70% after nine months. Establishment Costs

## Nickel mine
From 1953 to 1958 Nickel Rim mines operating around Sudbury, Ontario deposited their mine tailings in an impoundment near the mine. The water in the impoundment was later tested and found to have low pH and high concentrations of iron, sulphur and dissolved metals such as aluminum and nickel. This is due to the oxidation of the tailings (usually sulfide minerals like pyrrhotite).

## The Mineral Supply Chain Process for Essential Minerals
Nickel from lateritic ore is extracted through an extractive metallurgy process. This is done through a conventional roasting method which removes the moisture from the ore. Afterwards the nickel oxide is removed by using a reduction furnace which also greatly reduces the amount of chemical bound water. This results in a 75% pure form of nickel.

## process of nickel mining
After mining, nickel ores are further processed to upgrade their nickel contents from 1-4% typical of the ores to concentrates with grades in the range 10-20%. Concentration involves crushing the ore and separating nickel-bearing from other minerals using various physical and chemical processing methods.
