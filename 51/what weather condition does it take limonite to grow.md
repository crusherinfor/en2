## Limonite
Limonite (/ ˈ l aɪ m ə ˌ n aɪ t /) is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as FeO(OH)· n H 2 O, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. Limonite is one of the three principal iron ores, the others being hematite and magnetite

Limonite has been found to be very effective for ammonia reduction in inert environment at around 500°C; however, in the gasification environment in the presence of other gases, its activity is significantly reduced and would require temperature above 750°C to achieve conversion higher then 90% (Tsubouchi et al., 2008 ).

Ginger always pops up faster for me than turmeric. Turmeric is a slowpoke. The plants will wait until a couple of warm months pass, and then will really get started in summer.
