This is the monthly percentage you must pay for overheads. In this case, divide your monthly overhead costs by your total monthly sales. And to get the overhead rate multiplied by 100. Suppose, a company requires $40,000 per month as the total manufacturing overhead cost and the monthly sales are $250,000.
