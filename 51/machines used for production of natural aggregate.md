## Aggregate Production Function - Meaning, Factors, Formula, Graph
The Aggregate Production Function is the function that shows a technical relationship between aggregate inputs and aggregate outputs. It is a mathematical model that economists use to illustrate the change in productivity because of the changes in factors of production. It helps an economy to produce its potential level of output.
