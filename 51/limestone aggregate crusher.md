## Crushed Limestone - Uses & Benefits of This Natural Stone
Moreover,. Crushed limestone aggregates proved nearly 10% of high in strength compared to traditional gravels used in cement-concrete mixer. The strength comes from the angular shapes and sharp edges of crushed limestone aggregates compared to rounded-shaped gravels obtained from natural resources, which formed through weathering processes.
