## Where Do Coal Beds Originate - Realonomics
Most of Earth's coal originated as trees ferns and other tropical forest plants that lived in a warmer time in our history. That's why the world's coal beds are found on land. How coal beds are formed? Coal beds consist of altered plant remains. When forested swamps died they sank below the water and began the process of coal formation.
