## Mining | National Geographic Society
Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

## How gold is made - history, used, parts, procedure, industry, machine 
Gold, recognizable by its yellowish cast, is one of the oldest metals used by humans. As far back as the Neolithic period, humans have collected gold from stream beds, and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 B.C., when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry, religious artifacts, and utensils such as goblets.

The gold mining sector in the region is still largely informal and comprised of diverse actors playing different roles, most of whom are artisanal miners. Artisanal miners include all those who extract and process gold in an artisanal way, such as diggers or labourers, blasters, mill workers, ore washing, and concentration shed owners.
