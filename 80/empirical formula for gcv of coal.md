· Relationship between GCV and NCV based on the ultimate analysis is given by the equation 'NCV in kcal/kg = GCV - 50.6%H - 5.85%M - 0.191%O where H, M, O are the values of H2, moisture, and O2 of the coal. The CV of the coal can be determined either by calculation from chemical analysis or by burning a sample in calorimeter.

## empirical formula for gcv of coal
 India, the world's third largest coal producing country, is expected to maintain strong dependency on coal for the coming few decades. The gross calorific value (GCV) of coal is a key yardstick for many end users purchasing coal from suppliers, as it provides a clear measure of the useful energy content of a coal.

Can you mine coal in 7 days to die? Description. Coal is an easily obtainable multi-purpose resource that can be acquired by mining Coal Ore chopping down burnt trees and wooden debris in the Burnt Forest and Wasteland biomes. It can spawn to the side of the metal works building. It can also more rarely be obtained by looting containers or Zombies.
