## empirical formula for gcv of coal
 India, the world's third largest coal producing country, is expected to maintain strong dependency on coal for the coming few decades. The gross calorific value (GCV) of coal is a key yardstick for many end users purchasing coal from suppliers, as it provides a clear measure of the useful energy content of a coal.

Can you mine coal in 7 days to die? Description. Coal is an easily obtainable multi-purpose resource that can be acquired by mining Coal Ore chopping down burnt trees and wooden debris in the Burnt Forest and Wasteland biomes. It can spawn to the side of the metal works building. It can also more rarely be obtained by looting containers or Zombies.
