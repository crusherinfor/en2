Ore is a deposit in Earth's crust of one or more valuable minerals.The most valuable ore deposits contain metals crucial to industry and trade, like copper, gold, and iron.. Copper ore is mined for a variety of industrial uses. Copper, an excellent conductor of electricity, is used as electrical wire. Copper is also used in construction. It is a common material in pipes and plumbing material.

## Types of Iron Ore: Hematite vs. Magnetite
In Asia, a great deal of mining for hematite ore is done in China. Known reserves include the Tung-Yeh-Chen hematite ore deposit and the Dongye hematite ore deposit. One of the major advantages hematite ore has over other types like magnetite ore is its high iron content. That makes the iron extraction process much less costly and time consuming.

In many ways, the miners who went to work underground in Nevada and elsewhere in the late-1800s were guinea pigs. Square set timbering, the practice of building perfect cubes to account for the sporadic pockets of ore unique to the Comstock Lode, solved the deadly cave-ins that had been endemic to site, but only after countless lives had been lost.
