## Cost Benefit Analysis And Its Environmental Impact in Mining
The cost benefit analysis is a useful tool to predict the damage caused by the mining in term of its impact of cost which can help management to take precautionary measure to minimize the damage and reduce the cost. It will heavily reduce the costs of health service, improved productivity, minimize the losses of crops and forests, improve the

## Coal: building Australia's future | Minerals Council of Australia
Coal is a cornerstone Australian industry built on the efforts of hard working Australians with the majority in regional areas. It has a strong future which can meet the requirements of a modern economy. The industry employed around 50,000 workers in 2020 with another 120,000 indirect jobs supported by the coal industry. In Australia exported 213 Mt of thermal (energy)

## Carbon emission assessment and control measures for coal mining in 
Therefore, methane emissions are the largest contribution of carbon emissions during coal mining, and if the methane of mining coal could be recycled, it would improve the level of safety and economic benefits while reducing emissions in mines (Bibler et al. 1998). Therefore, the coal mine emission reduction work is mainly focused on the

## What Are the Benefits of Mining? - Research Summary
First of all, mining creates jobs. It is dangerous work and every year people suffer serious injuries in mining accidents. Some people even die. But demand for metals, crystals, coal, and other minable substances is only increasing. Another benefit of mining is that it spurs technological development.

The coal industry is currently proposing 23 new coal mines and mine extensions in NSW with a combined additional annual production of more than 155 million tonnes. This is equivalent to around 15 new Adani mines' worth of output. The rush to mine coal is accelerating, not slowing, as proponents scramble for approvals

The economic landscape for coal mining has changed dramatically in the past two decades.  Coal industry interests may be stronger in the ARC region, leading to a larger proportion of benefits flowing to mine owners rather than mine workers and the local population, though variation in average worker skills is another explanation.
