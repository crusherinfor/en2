Lignite is the lowest quality coal, used almost exclusively as fuel in power plants. It also applies to generation of synthetic natural gas, production of briquettes (used for home heating) and extraction of wax and bitumen. The largest proven lignite reserves are located in Russia, Australia, and Germany.

Coal is a non-clastic sedimentary rock. They are the fossilized remains of plants and are in flammable black and brownish-black tones. Its main element is carbon, but it can also contain different elements such as hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen. Unlike coal minerals, it does not have a fixed chemical composition and crystal structure.
