The inertial forces in modern high-speed machines attain high values. The forces of inertia, which vary in magnitude and direction, disrupt the normal operations of the elements of the machine and are sources of vibrations and noise, which adversely affect the operating personnel and prevent the normal functioning of other mechanisms and devices.

Machine analysis and diagnostics. Noise and vibration aren't just annoying; they represent energy emissions that indicate inefficiency in machinery. Noise and vibration indicate issues that can affect a machine's reliability, such as imbalanced parts, and can even cause machines to fail through their own damaging effects.

## Prediction of vibration radiation noise from shell of straw crushing 
In order to predict the radiation noise of the vibrating shell of the straw crusher in the design phase, the computational fluid dynamics-discrete element coupling method is initially used to simulate the airflow-straw coupled flow field in the straw crusher, and the pulsating pressure generated by the coupled flow field is applied to the inner surface of the shell of the crusher.

Introduction. In Chapter 1, it is noted that the dynamic behavior of many rotors can be divided into three different classes: lateral, axial, and torsional. This chapter addresses both the axial and torsional behaviors of rotors. Generally, these two categories of behavior do not interact with one another, except in worm drives and bevel gears.

If the application requires working with feature sizes down to 0.1 mm (VC-E), however, vibration control equipment would be needed in order to achieve an environment conducive to this type of measurement. In this case, vibration isolators would be required to attenuate the floor vibrations. Since the performance of felt as a vibration isolator could not be determined by calculation in the

## Dynamics and Control of Machines | Journal of Vibration and Acoustics 
Topics: Machine dynamics is the fundamental basis for optimal machine design. Based on dynamic analysis of the system special control, damping and counterbalance arrangements can be foreseen, which would simplify operations, adjustment and maintenance during the lifetime of the machine. According to the authors' preface, the aim of writing
