## Crusher
A cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones.

Worn liners change the geometry of the crushing chamber and can result in drifting closed side settings, poor throughput, power consumption and product quality. Automatic setting regulation is often used to compensate for liner wear. The KCM can simulate wear in both gyratory and cone crushers, with or without regulated setting controls.
