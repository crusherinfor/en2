## Limestone
Coastal limestones are often eroded by organisms which bore into the rock by various means. This process is known as bioerosion. It is most common in the tropics, and it is known throughout the fossil record. Bands of limestone emerge from the Earth's surface in often spectacular rocky outcrops and islands.

## Restoring Limestone, Removing Mildew and Mold
For interior limestone, it may be necessary to dry limestone. Use a heat gun and gently dry the tiles. Check the moisture periodically by using a damp meter, and stop applying heat once the stone is dry all the way through. This is less necessary for exterior limestone, though cleaning should be saved for a warm and sunny day for proper drying.

What is a crinoid stems?Crinoids (cry'-noids) are called " sea lilies," but they are animals rather than plants. They look like plants, however, because the body skeleton or calyx generally is on the end of a stem made of button-like discs and held on the sea floor by either a stony anchor or root-like arms.

Solution: 1) Use coagulants and flocculants to improve the condensability and filterability of the ore. 2) Use various inhibitors (water glass, starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, polyacrylamide) to inhibit the flotation of the slime. When concentrating the flotation coarse concentrate, these reagents can also be used to inhibit the slime.

## How does weathering affect limestone? - Internet Geography
Limestone areas are predominantly affected by chemical weathering when rainwater, which contains a weak carbonic acid, reacts with limestone. This causes the limestone to dissolve. Carbon dioxide from the respiration of animals (and ourselves) is one cause of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Burning fossil fuels also contributes to this.
