## The South African Cement Manufacturing Industry, including Lime and 
Local producers of lime, cement and related products entered 2020 with declining production capacity utilisation rates, weakening demand and intensifying competition for market share. Although South Africa and its neighbours are oversupplied, imported cement continues to pour into the saturated market.

## Cement - Analysis - IEA
Initial estimates suggest that 4.3 Gt of cement were produced globally in 2020. This is a modest increase from 4.2 Gt the previous year, driven in large part by infrastructure-related stimulus projects in China. China is the largest cement producer, accounting for about 55% of global production, followed by India at 8%.
