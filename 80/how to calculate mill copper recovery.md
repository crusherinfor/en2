## Common & Basic Formulas for Mineral Processing Calculations
Concentration and Recovery Formulas. These are used to compute the production of concentrate in a mill or in a particular circuit. The formulas are based on assays of samples, and the results of the calculations are generally accurateâ as accurate as the sampling, assaying, and crude ore (or other) tonnage on which they depend.
