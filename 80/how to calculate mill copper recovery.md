## Common & Basic Formulas for Mineral Processing Calculations
Concentration and Recovery Formulas. These are used to compute the production of concentrate in a mill or in a particular circuit. The formulas are based on assays of samples, and the results of the calculations are generally accurate— as accurate as the sampling, assaying, and crude ore (or other) tonnage on which they depend.
