A wind electric system is made up of a wind turbine mounted on a tower to provide better access to stronger winds. In addition to the turbine and tower, small wind electric systems also require balance-of-system components. Turbines. Most small wind turbines manufactured today are horizontal-axis, upwind machines that have two or three blades.
