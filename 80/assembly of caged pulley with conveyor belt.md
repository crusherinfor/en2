The bend pulleys direct belt slack around the gravity take-up pulley. The entire assembly is incorporated into the bottom side of the conveyor frame and creates a constant tension on the belt. This self-tensioning setup allows the take-up to simply adjust to spikes in load or tension as it "floats" below the belt conveyor.

## Conveyor pulley
A conveyor pulley is a mechanical device used to change the direction of the belt in a conveyor system, to drive the belt, and to tension the belt.Modern pulleys are made of rolled shells with flexible end disks and locking assemblies. Early pulley engineering was developed by Josef Sitzwohl in Australia in 1948 and later by Helmuth Lange and Walter Schmoltzi in Germany

1. Divide the pulley's diameter (in inches) by 2. 2. Multiply the answer by the pulley's width, and then add 6. 3. Divide the answer from step 2 by 72 and round up. This is the number of strips and double-sided retainers you'll need. 4. Take the answer from step 3 and divide it by 4, then round up.
