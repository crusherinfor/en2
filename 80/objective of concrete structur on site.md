Concrete lasts for ages, even under very adverse conditions. Concrete can resist weathering action, chemical action, abrasion, and both tensile and compressive stress for long periods without compromising its structural integrity. This attribute makes a concrete structure more stable and suitable for places with rough conditions. 4. Long-Lasting
