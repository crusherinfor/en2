## The Aggregate Production Function - GitHub Pages
The aggregate production function describes how total real gross domestic product (real GDP) in an economy depends on available inputs. Aggregate output (real GDP) depends on the following: Physical capital—machines, production facilities, and so forth that are used in production. Labor—the number of hours that are worked in the entire economy.

Standard postulates concerning the aggregate production function are about marginal productivities - and the associated demand of labor and capital - which are to be negatively related to factor prices, namely the wage rate and the profit rate.

The Aggregate Production Function. An aggregate production function relates the total output of an economy to the total amount of labor employed in the economy, all other determinants of production (that is, capital, natural resources, and technology) being unchanged. An economy operating on its aggregate production function is producing its potential level of output.
