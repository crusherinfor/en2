## Theuft360
The calculation is based on the Pythagorean Theorem. Reduced to simple construction terms, it says that the foundation length squared plus the foundation width squared equals the foundation diagonal distance (opposite corner to opposite corner) squared..Foundations Cost Calculator.Estimate the cost of your groundworks easily using this awesome tool.

## Aggregate Crushing Value - Significance & Test Procedure
The crushing value of aggregates is measured in the ratio between the crushed aggregates, obtained from the IS sieve 2.36mm and the weight of the dried aggregate sample. At least three samples should be tested from the same batch and average value to get accurate results. The crushing value of aggregate = (W2/W1) x 100. Lab Report
