## Manufactured Sand (M-Sand)! Properties of M-Sand - Civil Rack
Apr 9, 2021What is Manufactured Sand (M-Sand)? Manufactured sand (M-Sand) is a replacement for river sand for concrete construction. M- Sand is made by crushing hard granite. The crushed sand particles are cube-shaped with grounded edges. After cleaning and grading, they can be used as building materials. The size of the M-Sand is less than 4.75mm.

## Advantages & Disadvantages of Manufactured Sand (M Sand) in Construction
7 days agoManufactured Sand (M-Sand) is among the most useful items in the construction process. Manufactured sand is produced after crushing hard granite stones (usually in cubical shape) into fine particles. In fact, they are crushed repeatedly until they reach a sand state. These fine particles are known as M Sand and are used in construction.

fineness modulus: an index reflecting the fineness of manufactured sand, the greater the fineness modulus, the coarser the sand. There are four fineness of modulus (Mx): coarse, medium, fine and ultra-fine. 1) coarse sand, Mx is 3.7-3.1, the average grain size is over 0.5 mm; 2) medium sand, Mx is 3.0-2.3, the average grain size is 0.5 mm-0.35 mm;

The manufactured sand has required gradation of fines, physical properties such as shape, smooth surface textures and consistency which makes it the best sand suitable for construction. These physical properties of sand provides greater strength to the concrete by reducing segregation, bleeding, honeycombing, voids and capillary.
