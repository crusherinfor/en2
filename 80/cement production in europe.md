## Cement producers explore hydrogen to tackle emission
A substantial amount of CO2 is released during the production of cement and its substrate- cement clinker. Limestone, which is the main ingredient for producing cement is the chief culprit behind the emission.  Europe and North America spearheaded into producing e-methane (methanation) on an industrial scale by combining green hydrogen with
