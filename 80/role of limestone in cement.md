## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

The manufacture of cement, a constituent of concrete, is responsible for 5.6% of global carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. 30-40% of these emissions are from thermal fuels (predominantly coal) used to heat the cement kiln, while 60-70% of the emissions are "process emissions" from the breakdown of limestone in a calcination reaction.

This renders limestone calcined clay cement (LC3) a viable alternative for the future of green cement. One of the main differences between LC3 and OPC is rheological behavior, which greatly influences practical application. Rheology plays a key role in the application of cementitious materials and in achieving successful concrete performance.
