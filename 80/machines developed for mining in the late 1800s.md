The typical Australian factory or mill in the late 1800s was powered by a horizontal stationary steam engine like this one built by Marshall of Gainsborough, England, in 1909.Note the white insulated pipe on the right delivering steam from a boiler and the belt on the left attached to the overhead line shafting to power the factory's machines.

## History of mining: five of the oldest mines still in operation
Mining salt as a trading commodity did not commence until the Mughal era in the 16 th century, and it wasn't until 1872 that the main tunnel was developed by British mining engineer Dr H Warth, on behalf of the British colonial powers. During the early years of British rule, the salt mine churned out around 28,000t to 30,000t per year of salt.

1 Stamps. Stamps were used in California gold mines around 1850. First developed in England and used by Cornish miners, stamps were heavy iron machines used to pound rocks containing gold quartz into a fine dust so the gold ore could be extracted. Small stamps were commonly powered by water wheels while larger ones ran by steam engines.

There were two big engineering problems in mining coal underground: A system to drain water from the mine. A system to ventilate the mine and to provide fresh air to the miners. A special problem in coal mines was the methane (a gas) that sometimes accompanied coal, and which could--and too often did--catch fire and explode. Andrew Roy was one

Demand for metal parts used in textile machinery led to the invention of many machine tools in the late 1700s until the mid-1800s. After the early decades of the 19th century, iron increasingly replaced wood in gearing and shafts in textile machinery. In the 1840s self acting machine tools were developed. Machinery was developed to make nails

## From Shovels to Machines - West Virginia
The Mines Today. From the days of the salt industry until the 1940s, most coal was loaded using hand tools like picks and shovels. Machines were introduced gradually during the early 1900s, allowing miners to load more coal in less time. Mechanization began with undercutting machines around 1900 and advanced to loading machines in the 1920s.

MCCORMICK REAPER. Reapers were machines developed in the early 1800s to help farmers harvest grain. The first commercially successful reaper was built in 1831 by Virginia-born inventor Cyrus Hall McCormick (1809 - 1884), who patented it in 1834 and first sold it in 1840 in Virginia. The McCormick reaper was horse-drawn and sharply reduced the amount of manual labor required to harvest grain.

Legends tell us that the Indians and later the Spanish were the first to "mine" the lands of what is now Utah. While there is a great deal of evidence to support these legends, the first recorded mining was conducted in 1847 by early Mormon pioneers, quarrying stone for buildings, coal for heat, iron for tools, and lead for bullets. Coal mining accidents were prevalent during the 1800s.

A milling machine is defined by Encyclopedia Britannica as a "device that rotates a circular tool that has a number of cutting edges symmetrically arranged around its axis.". It may sound like a circular saw, but functionally it's more like a punch-hole. Any shape that can be attached to the cutter can be reproduced in metal.
