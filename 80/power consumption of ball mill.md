## Optimization of Rolling Schedule for Single-Stand Reversible Cold 
First, a multiobjective optimization model composed of an energy consumption function and equal power margin function was designed, and these objective functions were calculated based on the proposed mathematical model of the rolling process of single-stand cold rolling mill suitable for practical engineering applications.

Aug 01 2001 Typical power consumption for a 5-m diameter by 7-m-long ball mill is between 2.5 and 3.5 MW. The actual proportion of this energy usefully used in size reduction is thought to be very low perhaps in the range of 1-5. Significant financial and environmental benefits can be obtained by improving this efficiency even slightly.

## power consumption of ball mill
Charge behaviour and power consumption in ball mills. 01/08/2001 The specific power consumption for these two ball shapes is shown in Fig. 16. For Nâ¤75% there is no change in the mill power draw. This occurs because the center of mass of the charge is little changed by the particle shape at these speeds.
