Mining and processing of iron ore involves coarse crushing and screening. Iron ore is beneficiated by crushing and then separating the iron from the gangue minerals through screening. This is usually so efficient that lower grade ore can be treated especially when the magnetite is quite coarse. Common iron ore crushers are jaw crusher, cone

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
