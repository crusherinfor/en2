## Is exposure to airborne concrete, stone, brick, or granite dust 
When materials such as concrete, stone, brick, or granite are cut or ground by workers, it can create extremely fine dust particles, which can make their way deep into the lungs if inhaled. These silica dust particles can cause scarring in the lungs, leading to a serious and irreversible lung condition known as silicosis.
