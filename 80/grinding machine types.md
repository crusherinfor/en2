## AN Overview of Grinding Machines and Their Types - Expedited Quoting
Grinding Machines and Their Types. A grinding machine, also known as grinder, is a machine tool used for grinding. Grinding machines use an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool, with each grain of abrasive on the wheel's surface cutting a small chip from the workpiece through shear deformation.Grinding is commonly done to finish workpieces that must show high surface quality (surface
