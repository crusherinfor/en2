Sand settles in the wellbore due to low production velocities, which slowly cover the reservoir section. If the sand trapped is not cleared, they form into sand plugs, which then fall into the wellbore and causing loss of production. In term of facilities, sand production causes erosion to the downhole facilities.

## Sand Production - OilField Geomechanics
Sand Production or 'Sanding' is the failure of the producing formation, followed by the flow of failed rock into the wellbore. Very often the flow of failed rock can come to the surface and into surface facilities. Particularly for high rate gas wells, sanding is a major safety issue and the produced solids can erode both downhole and surface flow lines.
