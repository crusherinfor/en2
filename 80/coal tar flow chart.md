## Coal Tar and its Distillation Processes - IspatGuru
The normal yield of coal tar during the coal carbonizing process is around 4 %. Coal tar has a specific gravity normally in the range of 1.12 to 1.20, but exceptionally it can go upto 1.25. It depends on the temperature of carbonization. The lower specific gravity tars are generally produced when low carbonization temperatures are used.
