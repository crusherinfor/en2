## Smelting
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore, to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.
