One of the earliest methods for extracting gold, salt cementation, was perfected through the Iron Age. When the Lydian Empire was standardizing the purity of the gold and silver they were using for the world's earliest coinage, this was the method they relied on. When mined, gold is commonly merged with silver as an alloy called electrum.

The most common solvent is cyanide, which must be combined with oxygen in a process known as carbon-in-pulp. As the cyanide and oxygen react chemically, gold in the pulp dissolves. When workers introduce small carbon grains to the tank, the gold adheres to the carbon. Filtering the pulp through screens separates the gold-bearing carbon.
