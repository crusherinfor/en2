Malachite is a green copper carbonate hydroxide mineral with a chemical composition of Cu 2 (CO 3 ) (OH) 2. It was one of the first ores used to produce copper metal. It is of minor importance today as an ore of copper because it is usually found in small quantities and can be sold for higher prices for other types of use.
