## Difference Between Marble and Granite - R.K. MARBLES INDIA
The most significant difference between granite and marble is its absorbency. The marble is laxer and more absorbent than granite. Granite, whose crystalline structure makes it more resistant to staining, abrasion, and discolouration, is, in fact, the hardest of all-natural stones. It may be damaged by cleaning liquids.

## Difference Between Granite and Marble
The extent to which the stone is porous, defines the amount of stains on it. Marble is more porous hence the chances of it to stain easily are higher and requires more care. Granite is not that prone to stains. To sum up, granite and marble are both natural stones. Granite is sturdier of the two as it does not scratch and stain easily.
