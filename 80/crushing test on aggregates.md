2. It is the intent of this test method to only determine the percent of crushed particles created by crushing or other mechanical means and not the additional crushed/fractured aggregates created by laboratory processes. With this in mind, it is important that the tester handle aggregates for this test carefully. J. HEALTH AND SAFETY

Crushing Value Test of Aggregates Civil Bull. The standard aggregate crushing test is done on aggregates passing 12.5 mm sieve and retained on 10 mm sieve and make those surface dry by heating at 11 to 110°C for four hours and cooled to room temperature. Surface dry aggregates are filled into the standard cylinder in three-layer.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - The Constructor
Aggregate crushing value test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive load. Coarse aggregate crushing value is the percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions

## What are Tests on Aggregates with its Types? [GATE Notes] - BYJU'S Exam 
Various Tests on Aggregates are done to test the quality of aggregates such as aggregate abrasion test, flakiness index test, aggregate crushing test, aggregate impact test, elongation index test, etc. Before discussing the different types of tests on aggregates, we will discuss, what are aggregates. Aggregates are inert granular materials like sand, gravel, or crushed stone used in concrete

The soft aggregates will be quickly ground to dust, whilst the hard aggregates are quite resistant to crushing effect. The test also will determine the quality of the aggregate. The L.A. Abrasion test is widely used as an indicator of the relative quality or competence of mineral aggregates.
