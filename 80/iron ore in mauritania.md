## The Adventures in Mauritania - Our Ultimate Iron Ore Train Experience!
Banc D'Arguin National Park: Where the Desert meets the Ocean. After a 12-hour iron ore train ride, we headed immediately to Banc D'Arguin National Park. With a trip filled with a lot of dust, one shower isn't enough; so we swam and let the Atlantic Ocean do its magic. Swim, relax, repeat - that was our mantra.
