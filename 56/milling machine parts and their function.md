## Milling
The basic milling machine parts are base, column, arbor, knee, saddle, table, overhanging arm, elevating screw, ram etc. The machine learning algorithm then uses this input to create a math function. In other words, training is the process whereby the algorithm works out how to tailor a function to the data. The output of such a function is
