## How Is Gold Formed? Origins and Process - ThoughtCo
Gold sank to the Earth's core during the planet's formation. It's only accessible today because of asteroid bombardment. Theoretically, it's possible to form gold by the nuclear processes of fusion, fission, and radioactive decay. It's easiest for scientists to transmute gold by bombarding the heavier element mercury and producing gold via decay.

##  Chapter 5 Gold Mine Tailings As a Source of Contamination
The gold mine tailings produces acidic leachate as discussed in Chapter 2, due to the oxidation of pyrite and other sulphide minerals. The acidity and associated trace elements will leach into the underlying soils under normal soil drainage conditions. There are a number of natural buffering reactions that occur in soils that can partially or

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
Removing the gold-bearing rock from the ground is just the first step. To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.

We had gold prices around $250 per ounce—that was April 2001—rising to a peak of around $1,900 per ounce in September 2011. Then after that period, a dramatic fall in prices. If you look at the industry over these periods—so the 2000s and then up to 2010—it's been very different behavior.

In placer mining, the gold is retrieved by metal detecting, panning, cradling, sluicing and dredging. Using gravity and water to separate the dense gold from the other materials that surround it, this is the most common gold mining category for amateur gold hunters. Hard rock mining is the process of using open pit or underground mining tunnels

SUCTION DREDGE MINING EXPLANATION. A suction dredge (SD) is (usually) an underwater vacuum that sucks up streambed material and delivers it via a hose to a sluice box floating on the surface. SDs are rated by the size of suction hose used, i.e.; a 2" dredge has a suction hose of 2" ID. An 8" SD has a hose 8" ID.

## Gold Mining Process
Next, blasting occurs to break down the rock making it easier to move. A fleet of excavators mine designated ore areas and move the gold containing ore to stockpiles. The stockpiles containing the ore will be processed to extract the gold. Trucks move waste to a waste rock stack, which can be rehabilitated to fill previously mined areas.

Similarly, gold karats also describe the purity of gold. However, gold karats are measured in portions of 24. For example, 24-karat gold is 100% gold, or 1000 fine, but a 12-karat gold means that the alloy contains only 50% gold, i.e. it is 500 fine.
