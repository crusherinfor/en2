## Gold extraction
Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e. gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as color) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calverite (AuTe), aurostibnite (AuSb
