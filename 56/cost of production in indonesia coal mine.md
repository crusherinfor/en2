## Can Indonesia's coal mines maximise strip ratios and boost reserves 
Report summary. The declining trend in strip ratios for Indonesia's coal mines have allowed producers to survive in periods of lower coal prices through reduction in production costs and margins. However, producers are likely to have sterilised coal and jeopardised future coal reserves with continuous mining in lower strip areas.
