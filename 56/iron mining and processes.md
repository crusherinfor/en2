The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

## The Six Main Steps of Iron Ore Processing | Multotec Canada
Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening. We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing. This step prevents overloading the crusher and increases its efficiency.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

After the iron ore has been prepared by crushing and grinding during ore extraction, the ore is actually processed. The aim of this is to reduce the undesirable high proportion of admixtures to a desired minimum in order to increase the iron content. This is done by processes such as flotation or magnetic separation.

## How Do You Mine Iron - Realonomics
How is iron extracted from the earth? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

Manufacturing Causes CO2 Gas: Electric vehicles are propelled by lithium batteries, and their manufacture generates significant CO2 emissions.Lithium batteries cost roughly 73 kg CO2-equivalent/kWh. One battery with a capacity of 40 kWh or 100 kWh emits 2920 kg and 7300 kg of CO2, respectively.. That lithium is a midwife to a low-carbon economy makes it less ugly than coal and less evil than oil.

## How does mine drainage occur? | U.S. Geological Survey
Mine drainage is formed when pyrite (an iron sulfide) is exposed and reacts with air and water to form sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can precipitate to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage. The acid runoff further dissolves heavy metals such as copper, lead, and mercury into groundwater or surface water.

## The Step-by-Step Process of Producing Iron from Iron Ore
It has to be derived from iron ore that occurs near the surface when mining. Then the iron derived after a long processing in the blast furnace is handed over to the iron and steel industry to make a huge amount of useful materials. Most of the iron, however, is used in the construction industry.  The process of manufacturing pig iron is a

## Stages Of Iron Mining - Tulip Projects
Iron Ore Smelting Process Bright Hub Engineering. Mar 13, 2010 The Mining of Iron Ore. Iron ore mining was a thriving industry in many parts of the world, with the smelters being located as close to the mines as possible. and the molten iron is directed into molds known as pigs where it solidifies to pig iron and is transferred to the next stage of processing.
