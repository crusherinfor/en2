## Quarry drill and blast: a vital first operation
Drilling and blasting is one of the first operations to be carried out in a quarry to gain the material for further processing. The vital process often starts with a detailed survey of the quarry face, which will enable the explosives engineer to design the blast and to plot where the shot holes should be drilled, enabling the task to be carried out safely and efficiently.

Quarrying is used mainly in the production of construction and building materials, such as solid stone or crushed rock for aggregates, or for raw materials for processes such as cement manufacture. As a technique, quarrying is normally only used where raw materials of adequate quality and size cannot be obtained economically by other means.

## How Does A Quarry Work? - Realonomics
How Does A Quarry Work? A quarry is a place where rocks sand or minerals are extracted from the surface of the Earth. A quarry is a type of mine called an open-pit mine because it is open to the Earth's surface. . The most common purpose of quarries is to extract stone for building materials. Quarries have been used for thousands of years.

Limestone mining is done out in the open. Once studies show the existence of stone at the site, the extraction is made by separating the rock in quarry benches and dividing it into blocks. Before beginning the quarrying process, a resource analysis is made. This study investigates the existence and quantity of stone at the site and also the economic viability of the process.
