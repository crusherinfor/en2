## Digging Deeper: Improving financial performance and reducing 
Some mine haul trucks feature $50,000 tires and consume up to 30 gallons of fuel an hour. It could cost over a million dollars a year to operate one of these mine haul trucks. These high costs are also combined with almost continuous use of equipment in mining industry. This combination allows even small improvements yield into major financial performance gains for miners.

The Real Cost of Mining Gold. Since the bull market for gold began in 2003, the world's major gold mining companies have produced tens of millions of ounces of gold and have raised (and written-off) many billions of dollars for capital expenditures and acquisitions. Despite a gold price that appreciated from $344 to $1260 an ounce from 2003

A mining operation also takes up land and changes the landscape. There are several factors that steer how much the impact is from a mining operation, where the most significant factor is how waste is handled. Other factors can be topography, climate, geology and the sensitivity of lakes, watercourses and the water table.

US GAAP Accounting treatment: Capitalize Costs • Development costs are usually carried forward until the mine is commissioned (production begins) because the expenditure is for future benefit from the mineral extraction. • Capitalized development costs are then amortized using the units-of-PwC production (UOP) method as the resources are mined.
