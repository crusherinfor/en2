All county owned yard waste management centers have their own basic rules, but do have to follow state wide regulations. At the yard waste recycling near me, they take backyard waste year round, but only process it for recycling between March 1 and Dec 24. For the off months they treat it as regular refuge and not like a wood dump.

## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.
