Non-renewable energy comes from sources that will run out or will not be replenished in our lifetimes—or even in many, many lifetimes. Most non-renewable energy sources are fossil fuels: coal, petroleum, and natural gas.Carbon is the main element in fossil fuels.For this reason, the time period that fossil fuels formed (about million years ago) is called the Carboniferous Period.

Coal is an abundant natural resource that can be used as a source of energy, as a chemical source from which numerous synthetic compounds (e.g., dyes, oils, waxes, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides) can be derived, and in the production of coke for metallurgical processes. Coal is a major source of energy in the production of electrical power

Anthracite is a hard, black, shiny form of coal that contains virtually no moisture and very low volatile content. Because of this, it burns with little or no smoke and is sold as a smokeless fuel. It is the highest rank of coal. Major components are carbon. Minor components are ash, hydrogen, sulphur, oxygen and nitrogen.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.

The basic idea behind energy conservation is to reduce the consumption of energy. So, even if you cannot reduce the usage of energy run appliances completely, shift to those which are more energy efficient. Lightbulbs are used in every house, so instead of using them, shift to LED's and CFL's which consume less energy.

## What is the definition of law of conservation of energy - Law info
The law of conservation of matter and energy states that matter is neither created nor destroyed but conserved. Humans do not have the ability to create or destroy matter (atoms) or energy. They can only rearrange the matter and energy. For example, an oxygen atom will cycle through a living system.

## Conservation of Energy | Encyclopedia
Conservation of energy has two very different meanings. In the popular sense, "conserve" means to "save" or "preserve." Electric energy for lights likely had its origin in burning coal, so turning off lights tends to preserve coal, a valuable natural resource. In the scientific sense, conservation alludes to constancy.

## conservation of energy | Definition, Principle, Examples, & Facts
conservation of energy, principle of physics according to which the energy of interacting bodies or particles in a closed system remains constant. The first kind of energy to be recognized was kinetic energy, or energy of motion. In certain particle collisions, called elastic, the sum of the kinetic energy of the particles before collision is equal to the sum of the kinetic energy of the
