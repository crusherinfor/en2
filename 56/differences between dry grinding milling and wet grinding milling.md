## Wet vs Dry Grinding
There has been a well established "truth" that wet grinding is more efficient than dry grind- ing. This should apply to ball mill grinding as well as autogenous grinding. It has been earlier shown that the effect of dry ball mill grinding increases considerably, when the fines are efficiently removed from the mill.

## Can wet grinder be used for dry grinding?145
What is difference between wet grinder and dry grinder? The particles ride along in the liquid and are crushed among the grinding media. Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation.

## What Are the Advantages of Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding?
Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.
