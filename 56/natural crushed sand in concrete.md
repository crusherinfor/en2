## Suitability of Crushed Manufactured Sand for Replacement of Natural 
Abstract. The global consumption of natural sand is very high, due to the extensive use of concrete or mortar. The fine and coarse aggregates generally occupy 60% to 75% concrete volume (70% to 85% by mass) and strongly influence the concrete's fresh and hardened properties. Now a day's sand is becoming a very scarce material.

Thus, fine aggregates from rock mining have been studied as a substitute for sand for concrete production (Manasseh 2010; Manguriu et al. 2013). This material, often named artificial sand, industrial sand or crushed rock sand (CRS) has less impurities, is more environmentally friendly and cheaper compared to NRS (Mundra et al. 2016).

## Aggregates - Cement
Natural gravel and sand are usually dug or dredged from a pit, river, lake, or seabed. Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete.
