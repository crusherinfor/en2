## Equipment You'll Find at a Typical Surface Mine
Stationary equipment at a surface mine typically performs hauling, processing, and other service functions. Structures provide offices, storage, and maintenance spaces. The following stationary equipment and structures are common to most surface mining operations: Conveyor systems. Feeders, bins, and hoppers. Crushers and screens.

## What are the three types of surface mining?
Mining techniques can be divided into two common excavation types: surface mining and sub-surface (underground) mining. Today, surface mining is much more common, and produces, for example, 85% of minerals (excluding petroleum and natural gas) in the United States, including 98% of metallic ores.

Syncrude began mining oil sands from Mildred Lake in 1978. Syncrude's mining operation was very similar to Suncor's, initially using draglines and bucketwheels to shovel the ore onto conveyors that transported the oil sands to the processing plant. The company transitioned to truck-and-shovel mining in the late 1990s.
