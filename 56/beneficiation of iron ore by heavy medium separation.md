Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

In 1936, a plant was designed employing organic liquid as a heavy media for treating anthracite coal containing ore. The heavy media process is usually used for treatment of coarse coal above 9.5 mm in size.

39.3.3 Heavy media separation. Heavy media separation dates back to several centuries. Initially, a fine magnetite was used as a heavy media. In 1936, a plant was designed employing organic liquid as a heavy media for treating anthracite coal containing ore. The heavy media process is usually used for treatment of coarse coal above 9.5 mm in size.

## Gold Ore Beneficiation Process and Equipment - Xinhai
With the depletion of high-grade gold ore reserves, research on medium and low-grade, refractory gold ores and strengthening of traditional gold beneficiation processes have become the mainstream trends in global gold beneficiation. Gold ore has high mining value, and its beneficiation process is relatively complex, and the beneficiation process and equipment are not the same.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ore - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Beneficiation of Iron Ore and the treatment of magnetic iron taconites, stage grinding and wet magnetic separation is standard practice.This also applies to iron ores of the non-magnetic type which after a reducing roast are amenable to magnetic separation. All such plants are large tonnage operations treating up to 50,000 tons per day and ultimately requiring grinding as fine as minus 500
