## coal mining | Definition, History, Types, & Facts | Britannica
coal mining, extraction of coal deposits from the surface of Earth and from underground. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth. Its predominant use has always been for producing heat energy. It was the basic energy source that fueled the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the industrial growth of that era in turn supported the large-scale exploitation of coal

However, there are open pit mining operations working on coal seams up to metres (1,000-1,500 feet) below ground level, for instance Tagebau Hambach in Germany.  For example, a study has found that among surface coal mine operations, dragline equipment produced the loudest sound at a range of 88-112 dBA.

## What is open pit coal mining?idegrillandbar
How does open pit coal mining work? Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.  To create an open-pit mine, the miners must determine the information of the ore that is underground. This is done through drilling of probe holes in the ground, then plotting each hole location on a map.
