## Making steel | ArcelorMittal
Making steel. Steel is made from iron ore, a compound of iron, oxygen and other minerals that occurs in nature. The raw materials for steelmaking are mined and then transformed into steel using two different processes: the blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace route, and the electric arc furnace route. Both processes are being continually improved

George Lobdell and J. M. Heck, founders of the Cape Fear Iron and Steel Company, operated the Endor Furnace near the Deep River in Lee County beginning in 1862. Iron ore was transported by boat from nearby mines to the furnace. The resulting iron stock was shipped to Fayetteville, where railroad wheels were fabricated.

## Iron and Steel Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
By definition, steel is a combination of iron with a small amount of carbon. Thousands of products having various chemical composition, forms, and sizes are made of iron and steel by casting, forging, and rolling processes. Iron and steel comprise about 95 percent of all the tonnage of metal produced annually in the United States and the world.

## Iron Mining Process - Minnesota Iron
From blasting to crushing to separation - more than 85% of the iron mined in the United States is mined in northeastern Minnesota to make our nation's steel. Blasting Taconite is a very hard rock. Using explosives, the taconite is blasted into small pieces. Transportation The taconite pieces are scooped up by electric shovels. Each

## Tata Steel Careers | Life at Tata Steel
Tata Steel acquired the Company in 1956 to meet its requirement of metallurgical grade coal for iron making. Subsequently, in 1976, West Bokaro was made a Division of Tata Steel. In 1974, when coal mines were nationalised, West Bokaro was exempted as it produced coal only for captive consumption of the Steel Works.

## Understanding Iron Ores and Mining of Iron Ore - IspatGuru
Mining (extraction), beneficiation, and processing of iron ore produces iron and steel. Mining is defined as removing ore material from a deposit and encompasses all activities prior to beneficiation. High grade iron ores (iron content greater than 62 %) are simply crushed, screened and shipped directly to the iron making unit (e.g. blast
