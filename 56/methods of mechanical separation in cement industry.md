Separation is a method of separating a mixture into its components. In handpicking, substances are just separated by just picking the impurities. Threshing is usually used by farmers on their farms during the harvesting process. In winnowing, the farmer is supposed to gently drop the mixture to the ground from a certain height.

Mechanical separation means to separate a material by a mechanical method such as removal of screws, cutting, grinding or crushing. For example, a covered electrical cable can be mechanically separated into an electrical cable and a cover. It is necessary to separate an electrical cable from a cover and analyze the sub - materials individually.

A separation process is a method that converts a mixture or a solution of chemical substances into two or more distinct product mixtures, a scientific process of distinguishing two or more substance in order to obtain purity. At least one product mixture from the separation is enriched in one or more of the source mixture's constituents. In some cases, a separation may fully divide the mixture

##  3.10. MECHANICAL SEPARATIONS - Queen's University at Kingston
To achieve separation in any reasonable time (a few seconds) the particles have to have diameters in the millimetre range. If the range of particle sizes extends up this high then settling is a good first stage in the separation sequence. 17.4.2. Cyclone Flow. Cyclones are one of the oldest methods of particulate separation.
