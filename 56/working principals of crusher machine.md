The moving jaw of the single toggle jaw crusher moves elliptically. A pendulum motion is being carried out by the double toggle jaw crusher. The crushing force is produced by an eccentric shaft. Then it is transferred to the crushing zone via a toggle plate system and supported by the back wall of the housing of the machine.
