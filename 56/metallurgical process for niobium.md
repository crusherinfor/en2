Therefore, the metallurgical industry has focused on the exploration and processing of Niobium (Nb). The use of Nb in heat treatments at high temperatures as superalloys began in 1970.  Together with the main raw materials used in the production process (niobium ore, called pyrochlore), several materials are included in the chemical process

## Deep Drawn Niobium Strip Metal's Process Research
Different production and processing technologies have different effects on Deep Drawn Niobium Strip Metal: (1) In the forging process, in order to better crush and refine the grains and obtain uniform grains, two forgings and one. Intermediate heat treatment can achieve the purpose well. (2) Through reversing rolling, the strip shape, thickness

## Tantalum Processing | TIC
Processing: extraction and refining. The extraction and refining of tantalum, including the separation from niobium in these various tantalum-containing mineral concentrates, is generally accomplished by treating the ores with a mixture of hydrofluoric and sulfuric acids at elevated temperatures. This causes the tantalum and niobium values to

Niobium is even harder to use than Tantalum as the temperature co-efficient of this material is far more difficult to control in production. Its sound is very complimentary to Tantalum if used carefully in sound critical parts of the circuit. Price will be £19.50 each for the 2 watt version.
