## Pellet Plant Process « Baldota
Pellet Plant Process. Raw material iron ore fines are fed to Iron ore grinding system (IOGS - 160 t/h) for grinding the ore to 85% -200 mesh. We use the wet grinding process for this. The slurry produced is then fed to filter press. For pelletisation, we require filter cake of 8.5% to 9% moisture, therefore we are adopting Pressure Filter

## Iron Oxide Pellet - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The blast furnace process is primarily used in the carbothermic reduction of oxides, such as iron, zinc, and lead. Most of the iron ore bodies commercially explored consist of iron oxides. Consequently, rich iron ore and/or iron oxide pellets formed from concentrate can be added directly to a blast furnace (see Iron Production).

##  Sponge Iron Production From Ore -coal Composite Pellets in Tunnel Kiln
pellets, standard charging of concentric layers of separate iron ore, coal fines, or their mixture, these pellets were tested at 1200. oC in the tunnel kiln. It was observed that metallization for indurated iron ore pellets, and concentric chargingwere limited to 80% to 83% where as composite pellets had a metallic iron of 88% to 89%.
