Introduction to Ore Deposits: Minerals form chief source of all the industrial metals and non-metals. The commonly used metals like aluminum, copper, iron, lead, zinc etc. are all manufactured using minerals as raw materials. Similarly non-metals like glass and refractories are also made from minerals. Minerals are also source of energy.

Vein deposits, such as those in Bolivia and the United Kingdom, usually occur in granite formations and are recovered by conventional underground hard-rock mining techniques.
