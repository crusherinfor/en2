10. The smelter is essentially a large pile of heat-resistant brick that can melt down various types of ore to produce bars of mostly pure metal. The bars can then be used in the construction of certain buildings, or they can simply be sold for a handsome profit. The miner also provides all smelting recipes. The lower intake port is for fuel only.

Copper was initially recovered from sulfide ores by directly smelting the ore in a furnace. The smelters were initially located near the mines to minimize the cost of transport. This avoided the prohibitive costs of transporting the waste minerals and the sulfur and iron present in the copper-containing minerals.

Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

The ore levels are given to the point of where the deposits turn green. So Copper will have a ore level of 1-49. The recommended level is given by what levels in Mining will allow you to still mine a large amount of yellow and orange ranked ore. At 125, you can start mining [Iron Ore]. The best place for this is Feralas or Western Plaguelands.
