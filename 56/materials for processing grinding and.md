## Material Processing - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Materials processing is central to the field of materials science and engineering, and is a vital step in manufacturing. The conversion of the starting material to the final product occurs in three steps: preparation of the starting material, processing operation, and post-processing operation (s). The processing operations can be divided into

## Grinding process
Centerless grinding is a high production process for continuously grinding surfaces in which the workpiece is supported not by centers or chucks, by a blade (figs. 16.1 a and b). Typical parts made by centerless grinding are roller bearings, piston pins, engine valves, camshafts, and similar components.
