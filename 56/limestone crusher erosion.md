## limestone formation erosion
erosion | National Geographic Society. Mar 20, 2018· Erosion is the process where rocks are broken down by natural forces such as wind or water. There are two main types of erosion: chemical and physical. Chemical erosion occurs when a rock's chemical composition changes, such as when iron rusts or when limestone dissolves due to carbonation.

Limestone is found in beds, and most limestone beds form in marine environments in which big deposits of organisms and carbonate precipitation build up over the years, like an ocean or large lake.
