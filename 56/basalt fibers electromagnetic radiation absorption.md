## Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)
Radiant energy100% (1/1) In physics, absorption of electromagnetic radiation is how matter (typically electrons bound in atom s) takes up a photon's energy — and so transforms electromagnetic energy into internal energy of the absorber (for example, thermal energy). When EM waves are absorbed by an object, the energy of the waves is converted

## Decoration of basalt fibers with hybrid Fe3O4 microspheres and their 
To develop high performances of inorganic fibers/ polymer composites, the interfacial interaction and dispersal of fibers are the two essential issues to be considered. Herein, we report the surface decoration of basalt fibers (BF) with hybrid Fe 3 O 4 microspheres (FePc-Fe 3 O 4) and their microwave absorption application in bisphthalonitrile composites was systematically investigated.

## Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)
In physics, absorption of electromagnetic radiation is how matter (typically electrons bound in atoms) takes up a photon's energy — and so transforms electromagnetic energy into internal energy of the absorber (for example, thermal energy). A notable effect is attenuation, or the gradual reduction of the intensity of light waves as they propagate through a medium.

Basalt is a type of igneous rock formed by the rapid cooling of lava at the surface of a planet. It is the most common rock in the Earth's crust. Basalt rock characteristics vary from the source of lava, cooling rate, and historical exposure to the elements. High quality fibers are made from basalt deposits with uniform chemical makeup.

While basalt fiber is still not widely used, it is slowly making its way into the hand of consumers. At price points that vary between S-glass ($5/lb to $7/lb) and E-glass ($0.75/lb to $1.25/lb), basalt fibers have properties more akin to S-glass. A common use is in the fire protection sector because of its high melt-point.
