## USA - Method for dewatering fine coal - Google Patents
The process of dewatering by displacement is capable of achieving the same level of moisture reduction as thermal drying but at substantially lower energy costs. Fine coals are dewatered in an energy efficient process in which a non-polar liquid or a mixture of different hydrophobic liquids are used to displace the water from the coal surface.

Minerals beneficiation is any process that improves the economic value of an ore, by removing the gangue material. This results in a higher grade product (concentrate) and a waste stream (tailings). Jord has a range of technology to treat both streams. These principally involve vacuum filtration, pressure filtration or flotation.

Abstract. Fine coal particles are difficult to separate effectively from liquids or other solids. Ultrasonic energy may be used to enhance the efficiency of the conventional fine-particle separation processes widely used in the coal and mineral industries. Flotation, settling and dew ate ring tests were conducted using several fine coal samples

Dewatering. With few exceptions, most mineral-separation processes involve the use of substantial quantities of water and the final concentrate has to be separated from a pulp in which the water-solids ratio may be high. Dewatering, or solid-liquid separation, produces a relatively dry concentrate for shipment. Partial dewatering is also

The economic potential of coal fines has led to developments in fine coal beneficiation processes, like spirals and froth flotation.  The capillary stage is the first dewatering stage, where the applied pressure or vacuum is less than the threshold pressure P T (related to the capillary pressure of the largest pores).

Remarks on Coal Beneficiation Process and Diagram. "Sub-A" Coal Flotation Systems have been successful for recovery of both coarse and fine coal. It is important, however, to employ a two-stage circuit for maximum efficiency in saving the plus 28 mesh fraction which is normally the most difficult to float.
