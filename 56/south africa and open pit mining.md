## Open Cast Mining in South Africa - SG
Open cast mining is a useful method of extracting ore near the surface. It allows teams to fast track box cut excavations on gold, platinum and uranium mines as it saves the need for the usual methodological approach. In this article we'll look at what we mean by open cast mining, along with its uses in South Africa. What is Open Cast Mining? Open cast mining, also known as open-pit mining

## Reactive Ground Blast Management in a South Africa Open Pit Zinc Mine
Reactive ground conditions increase the risk of explosives deflagration and/or unplanned detonations. Unexpected and highly reactive ground conditions were recently experienced at a large open-pit zinc mine in the Northern Cape of South Africa. The mine was found to have geologically bounded reactive zones within its rich zinc deposits.

Open-pit mining, which is quite different from strip mining, is often the most economical method of removing ore for further processing. It is a massive earthmoving exercise that usually takes the form of a cone-shaped excavation but, depending on the size and shape of the ore body, it could be any shape.
