## ball to powder ratio in ball mill
Feb 11, 2022Therefore, the ball milling treatment was used to remove sharp corners and smooth the surface of the precursor powder particles. Ball milling process was conducted in a planetary ball milling machine (QM-3SP04, Nanjing University Instrument Factory) equipped with four nylon ball mill tanks with an internal volume of 50 mL.

## ball and material ratio of mill ratio
The ball to powder ratio (BPR) is a processing parameter that is frequently used in both mechanical (ball) milling and mechanical alloying. A number of recent studies provided the BPR as a principal milling parameter while neglecting other parameters, such the vial volume, the diameter and quantity of milling balls and the powder mass.
