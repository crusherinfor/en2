## What Are the Benefits of Mining? - Research Summary
Mining is the practice of extracting ore, coal, clays, soils, or minerals from the ground for the purpose of using them. Mines have existed for thousands of years.  especially as we develop new ways to counteract the negative impact of mining on the environment. First of all, mining creates jobs. It is dangerous work and every year people

## impact of mining iron ore on the environment
The mining of mineral fuels for iron smelting also had a significant impact on the environmentâ€”often greater than that caused by the mining of iron ore. Coal mining exposed sulfur-bearing rock, causing acid mine drainage in large areas of the Appalachian coalfields.

The impact of mining and smelting of metal ores on environmental quality is described. Mines produce large amounts of waste because the ore is only a small fraction of the total volume of the mined material. In the metal industry, production of Cu, Pb, and Zn causes the greatest degradation of the environment.
