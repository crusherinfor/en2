## What Are the Differences Between The 7 Types of Crushers?
Jul 20, 2022Cone crusher looks like gyratory crusher but without a steep crushing chamber. Just like jaw crusher, it is also a compression type crusher whose reduction ratio is 4:1 to 6:1. When cone crusher works, it uses the force between moveable mantle and stationary bowl liner to crush material.

Cone Crusher Applications. Cone crushers, a type of compression crusher, have less versatility than a horizontal impact crusher, but a great capability to guarantee a finished product size. If set at 2", typically 80% of the final product will meet the 2" target which is not something that can be replicated by jaw crushers or impact crushers.

Primary crushers are solidly built to receive large lumps of rock directly from the mines and designed for large tonnage throughputs. Basically, gyratory crushers consist of a fixed solid conical shell or bowl (also called concaves) and a solid cone within the bowl called a breaking head (Figure 5.1).The breaking head is fixed to a central spindle, which is hydraulically suspended or

## what product comes from a cone crusher
The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure ). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.
