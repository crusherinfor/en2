## Aluminium recycling process - AdTech China - sales@adtechamm
The aluminum recycling process is fairly straightforward in its major steps. Aluminum cans (UBC) recycling, for example, is a closed-loop process, which means the new product at the end of the recycling process is the same as the source product. It goes like this:

## Environmental Benefits of Aluminum Recycling
Aluminum is a difficult natural resource to obtain and purify. In that mining consumes a great deal of electricity, and the entire process pollutes the air, land, and water. Everyone on the earth may know the benefits of Aluminum recycling near me since it is reused. It is a natural product that is produced largely, and also it is transported

## Aluminium recycling
Aluminium recycling is the process by which scrap aluminium can be reused in products after its initial production. The process involves simply re-melting the metal, which is far less expensive and energy-intensive than creating new aluminium through the electrolysis of aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3), which must first be mined from bauxite ore and then refined into aluminium oxide using the Bayer
