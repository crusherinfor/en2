## COP26: Nigeria's coal deposits get 2030 final development deadline
Some experts say Nigeria holds over 2.8 billion tons of coal but proven reserves were put at 379m tons by the Ministry of Solid Minerals, making it the world's 44 th largest proven reserves. Large swaths of coal deposits can be found in Nasarawa, Enugu, Gombe, Kogi and in 15 other states, much of which may never be tapped.

Oil was first discovered in Nigeria in the mid-1950s after decades of fruitless exploration. The country's first field began producing in 1958 at a rate of 5,100 BPD. Production grew fast, and today, Nigeria pumps close to 2 million BPD, which makes it the largest producer of crude oil in Africa. Nigeria joined OPEC in 1971 before it even had.

During the 1970s Nigeria had a prosperous, export-orientated mining industry. Before the discovery of oil, the West African nation had developed strong production operations for coal, tin and columbite. The discovery of hydrocarbons eclipsed these activities and relegated mining to an economic footnote. However, with the recent decline in the global price of oil and reductions in production

Nigeria started major production of coal, tin, and columbite in the 1940s. In 1956, when oil was discovered, the focus shifted from mining to oil and the mineral industries suffered. In the 1960s, the civil war led to mining experts leaving the country and mines being abandoned. Mining regulations drastically changed, and productivity declined.
