## Leaching (chemistry)
Leaching is the process of a solute becoming detached or extracted from its carrier substance by way of a solvent.. Leaching is a naturally occurring process which scientists have adapted for a variety of applications with a variety of methods. Specific extraction methods depend on the soluble characteristics relative to the sorbent material such as concentration, distribution, nature, and size.

2.1 Leaching. Most copper leaching is done by piling broken ore (∼0.5% Cu) into flat-surface, 3-10m high, 10 4 -10 5 m 2 heaps of ore and then sprinkling dilute sulfuric acid lixiviant on to the heap surface. The lixiviant trickles down through the heap and leaches copper from its minerals to produce a pregnant leach solution containing 1-5kg Cum −3.
