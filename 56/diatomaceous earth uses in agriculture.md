## Diatomaceous Earth as an Organic Pesticide - Big Blog Of Gardening
Diatomaceous Earth is a 100% organic pesticide, derived from the fossilized remains of Diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae. Diatoms are phytoplankton used as food by freshwater and marine animals. When they die, their skeletons settle to the ocean or lake floor and over time become thickly fossilized deposits.
