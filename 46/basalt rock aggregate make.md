Known as one of North America's hardest rock, trap rock is actually altered basalt, or volcanic (non-porous) rock with irregular seams. As boulders, it exhibits subtle hues of gray, blues, reds, greens, and purples but in crushed aggregate form the dark blue gray color dominates, creating a unique richness Dresser Trap Rock is known for.
