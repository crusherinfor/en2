A simple method for measuring the impurity content of limestone was developed by correlating the amount of impurities and the turbidity of suspensions of residue from limestone dissolved in 20% acetic acid. Impurity removal more than 50% with limestone recovery better than 85% was

performed using both uncoated and iron coated limestone and are compared in removal efficiency. Kinetics studies showed that zinc is removed to a maximum level after 24 hours, while cadmium takes only 15 minutes. The effect of pH on removal of heavy metals was also studied. Metals are analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission
