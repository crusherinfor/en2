## Working and Principle of Colloidal Mill : Pharmaguideline
This mill uses a hydraulic system to shear the material into the final product. It mainly works on the material that will be suspended on the liquid or emulsion. As you continue to add the heavier liquid, the suspension floats to the narrow gap and the shearing process continues. As the process continues, the two viscous elements continue to mix.
