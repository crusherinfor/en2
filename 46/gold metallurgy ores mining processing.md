## gold processing | Britannica
By 2000 bc the process of purifying gold-silver alloys with salt to remove the silver was developed. The mining of alluvial deposits and, later, lode or vein deposits required crushing prior to gold extraction, and this consumed immense amounts of manpower. By ad 100, up to 40,000 slaves were employed in gold mining in Spain.

## What is ore handling?pro
What is the purpose of processing ore? Mineral processing, art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock, or gangue. It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.

## Roasting (metallurgy)
It is a step in the processing of certain ores. More specifically, roasting is often a metallurgical process involving gas-solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component (s). Often before roasting, the ore has already been partially purified, e.g. by froth flotation.

However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum.

## Gold processing 101 - Mining Magazine
Metallurgical processing of metalliferous ores in general and gold ores in particular, consists essentially of three stages, often colloquially referred to as: Bashing (crushing); Mashing (grinding); and Hashing (extraction/recovery) In the context of flowsheet selection, the bashing and mashing stages are relatively straightforward.

From the perspective of metallurgical processing, gold ores can be classified into free-milling and refractory ores. Their extractive metallurgy are largely driven by mineralogical factors such as: gold particle size, association with other minerals, coatings and rimmings, presence of cyanicides, oxygen consumers and preg-robbers, presence

## The Metallurgy of Gold (6th Edition) - Mining and Mineral Processing 
Metallurgy of Gold by T.K. Rose is a reference text, and documents gold mining and mineral processing procedures from years ago. As an older text, the book uses a serif font, meaning that the text characters have little tails, as was commonly used on older documents. (Sans serif fonts are easier to read and are far more often used in current

## Non-ferrous metallurgical processing - Lhoist
metallurgical processing. Lime products play a key role in the mining and extraction of non-ferrous metals, including aluminum, copper, gold, nickel, cobalt, uranium, titanium and lithium. Lime is also important for the pyrometallurgical refining and smelting of several non-ferrous metals. In addition, lime products are used in effluent and
