Oct 30, 2009 · All you need is 1 tin can, some plaster of paris and a propane torch. The forge I made can melt brass and that means 2000 degrees F. I just used a torch like my dad uses. If you make it with a can bigger than 6 inches long you will want two torches. It is not foolproof, if you run it too long the plaster will crack and every once and a while you will need to put new plaster on

All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.
