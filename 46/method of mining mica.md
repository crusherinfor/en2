## Mining Mica - The True Costs Of Beauty Products
In general, mining is an invasive process that damages far more than the mining site itself. The creation of open pits induces soil erosion, the formation of sinkholes, and could potentially contaminate surface water, groundwater, and soil. The mining also leads to deforestation, with trees gradually cleared to develop more land for mining mica.

Four main methods of mining are available: underground, open surface (pit), placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and often used to reach deposits that are deeper. Surface mines are usually used for deposits that are shallower and less valuable. Placer mining is used in river channels, beach sands, or other

Solonopole permits cover historic artisanal mining sites previously mined for lithium, Coltan (tantalum and niobium) and tin; Over 20 historical small-scale mines have been identified in field exploration. Mining was only undertaken to less than 10 meters vertical depth due to restrictions of hard pegmatite material requiring blasting.
