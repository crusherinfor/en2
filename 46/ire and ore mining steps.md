## USA - Method and equipment for narrow ore mining - Google
For narrow ore mining, shrinkage stopping is used with working equipment, such as a working platform or mining rig (30), which is suspended in guide sections (38) in the roof of the mining chamber, and from which drilling and charging is carried through, the mining chamber communicating with a raise. In the raise, which follows the inclination of the ore body, a transport lift is used designed

## Ore Pass - Mining Fundamentals
An ore pass is a vertical or near-vertical opening, which is created during underground mining operations to transfer materials. It is designed based on the gravitational force between different ground levels, in order to provide a convenient material handling system and reduce haulage distances. Ore passes are used to drop mined ores into
