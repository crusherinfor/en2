## What is Asphalt Pulverizer? - Colorado Pavement Solutions
Asphalt Pulverizer Process. Asphalt pulverizing is the process of grinding up both the top layer of asphalt and its underlying aggregate to create a new base surface for fresh asphalt. During pulverizing, a machine with rotating blades reaches anywhere from 2 to 12 inches down to pulverize different layers of asphalt into one even mix.

Pulverization - Pulverization refers to crushing and grinding. In this method, municipal waste is pulverized in grinding machines so as to reduces its volume and physical character. Pulverization is the first process applied to solid waste where the main objective is to recover material from waste that can be recycled or marketed.

## Introduction to the Full-Depth Reclamation / Pulverization Process 
Full-depth reclamation is an asphalt pavement recycling process in which failed pavement and base materials from an existing roadway/parking lot are pulverized, mixed with cement (or lime) and water, and compacted to create an improved stabilized base for a new paved surface. There are many benefits of this relatively new process.

## Pulverization 1: Definition and purpose | THINKY USA
Definition of pulverization. "Pulverization" (comminution, crushing, grinding) is the process of applying an external force to a (solid) material of a certain size to destroy it and reduce it into pieces that are smaller than the original size. Pulverization has long been done for many materials, including ore, glass, ceramics, grains

## Introduction to the Full-Depth Reclamation / Pulverization Process 
Full-depth reclamation is an asphalt pavement recycling process in which failed pavement and base materials from an existing roadway/parking lot are pulverized, mixed with cement (or lime) and water, and compacted to create an improved stabilized base for a new paved surface. There are many benefits of this relatively new process. It saves money and resources by using existing materials
