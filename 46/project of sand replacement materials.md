## Drainage
Drainage is the natural or artificial removal of a surface's water and sub-surface water from an area with excess of water. The internal drainage of most agricultural soils is good enough to prevent severe waterlogging (anaerobic conditions that harm root growth), but many soils need artificial drainage to improve production or to manage water supplies.

Apr 22, 2017 Abstract-This research exploits ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) as a replacement of sand on the physico-mechanical properties of concrete. Using these natural materials helps in the natural exchequer such as aggregate and cement. In addition to, it also helps in reducing the cost of manufacturing concrete.

## Sand Structure: Measuring Density and Porosity of Sand | Science Project
Divide the mass of the sand by the volume of the sand. Calculate the air space volume. It will be equal to the volume of the sand alone plus the volume of the water alone minus the volume of the sand/water mixture. Calculate the fractional air space. Another way to measure the air space is as a percentage of the total volume of the sand.

## Suitability of Crushed Manufactured Sand for Replacement of Natural 
Abstract. The global consumption of natural sand is very high, due to the extensive use of concrete or mortar. The fine and coarse aggregates generally occupy 60% to 75% concrete volume (70% to 85% by mass) and strongly influence the concrete's fresh and hardened properties. Now a day's sand is becoming a very scarce material.

## New Hampshire SP Sawyer--Medlicott House
Sawyer owned a share in the bridge. The town history indicates that the road from the ferry to River Road was probably discontinued in 1828 as a bridge was built over the sand gully near Joseph Sawyer's and the road toward Bradford was laid out in that year.^^ The present arched metal bridge over the Connecticut dates to 1928.

Concrete is an artificial stone manufactured by mixing together coarse and fine aggregates, cement, water and often other components such as cement replacement materials, e.g., pulverised fuel ash, and chemical admixtures, e.g., superplasticisers. The grading of an aggregate defines the proportions of particles of different size in the aggregate.
