## beneficiation of limestone - Stark
Lime Stone Beneficiation Trade Technology Project. Limestone for Portland cement must be beneficiated to produce uniform raw material for the kiln. Beneficiation is defined as the improving of limestone composition so as to produce an economically usable raw material. Some limestones are difficult to beneficiate for various reasons, most of which.

Beneficiation is a process by which low-grade limestone, which would otherwise have been rejected, is converted into raw material for cement production. AV Dharmakrishnan, Chief Executive Officer, Ramco Cements, said the beneficiation plant will help the company extend the life of its limestone mines by 25-30 years.

## Understanding Limestone in Cement - Concrete Construction
Because the limestone is softer than the clinker it will grind preferentially, resulting in a cement with a better particle size distribution with less energy. The limestone also requires less processing and does not undergo calcination, so it releases less waste in its production. The resulting cement will perform at least as well as cements
