## Aggregates - Types of Aggregates | Coarse Aggregate, Fine Aggregate
Aggregate is a granular material, such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, crushed hydraulic-cement concrete, or iron blast-furnace slag, used with a hydraulic cementing medium to produce either concrete or mortar. Those particles that are predominantly retained on the 4.75 mm (No. 4) sieve, are called coarse aggregates. Those particles passing the 9.5 mm (3/8 inch)

## What Are the Properties of Aggregates for Concrete?
The aggregates crushing value gives a relative measure of resistance of an aggregate to crushing under gradually applied compressive load. The aggregate crushing strength value is a useful factor to know the behavior of aggregates when subjected to compressive loads. Also read: Crushing Value Test of Aggregates 13. Impact Value
