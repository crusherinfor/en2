## How to Recycle Concrete - RecycleNation
When the mixture gets wet, the cement acts as a paste that holds the rock together and creates extremely strong structures. To make concrete, a manufacturer needs to get the correct mix of cement and rock. According to the Portland Cement Association, the typical combination is 10-15% cement, 60-75% rock, and 15-20% water.

##  Recycling Concrete Pavements and Utilizing Recycled Concrete Aggregate 
(April 3, 2020) The practice of recycling concrete pavements and using processed recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) within new pavement structures is considered a standard and essential practice by the concrete pavement industry due to numerous economic, environmental and societal (sustainability) benefits.

Crushed concrete can then be reused as an aggregate in new concrete or in any structural layer. This reuse of concrete reduces the need for mining other aggregates such as gravel and relying on the transportation of aggregates. When used in new concrete, the recycled crushed concrete aggregate is usually mixed with a virgin aggregate.

## How Is Recycled Concrete Aggregate Made? - AEI Screens
Recycled concrete aggregate is also known as "crushed concrete". This name paints a plain picture of what RCA is: crushed asphalt and concrete debris that has been screened, cleaned, and reused in other construction projects.  Currently, RCA sees limited use, making up only a fraction of total new concrete construction. There is a belief
