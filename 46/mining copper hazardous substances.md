##  Copper Hazards to Fish, Wildlife, and Invertebrates: a Synoptic  - Usgs
Copper toxicosis in terrestrial higher plants is rare but occurs on mine spoils and where copper-rich manures or fungicides are used excessively (Schroeder et al. 1966; NAS 1977; Alva et al. 1995; Arduini et al. 1995). Copper is among the most toxic of the heavy metals in freshwater and marine biota (Schroeder et al.

## First, lithium-ion batteries are classified as hazardous waste material 
First, lithium-ion batteries are classified as hazardous waste material due to their chemical composition, which makes recycling difficult. On the economical side, the resale value of lithium-ion battery components are low compared to the costs associated, so the incentive to invest in a recycling process is also low.

Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.
