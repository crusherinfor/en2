## How Gold is Refined - The Gold Refining Process - Canada Gold
The Royal Canadian Mint refines their gold using these five steps: 1. Pre-melt. Doré bars in purities ranging from 5% to 95% are melted in a furnace. Dip samples are taken from the molten gold to determine its purity. 2. Chlorination. Chlorine gas is injected into the molten metal mix. All metals but gold float to the surface to form a slag of

## Gold Refining Process - Refine Max Inc
It involves a lot of processes and chemical reactions to extract out metal from its ore. In hydrometallurgical refining, the concentration of the ores of metals is done by leaching or dissolution into the water by using agents. Next, the separation of metals occurs by purifying metal from the leach solution. Later, purification occurs by either

## History Of Gold Refining | My Gold Guide
The technology boom for developing pure gold continued with E.B. Miller's process of refining impure gold with chlorine gas (patented in Britain in 1867) and Emil Wohlwill's electro-refining process (introduced in Hamburg, Germany, in 1878). In fact, gold with purity of 99.99 percent is created using a combination of the processes.

The process begins when the refinery facility receives the raw material to extract gold.This can include ore, rocks, gold nuggets, scrap gold, jewelry, and doré bars. Doré bars have a gold purity of 80% and are directly produced by miners. The refinery takes that raw material and reliquefies the metal in an extremely hot furnace, as gold's melting point is a scolding 1,948 degrees Fahrenheit.
