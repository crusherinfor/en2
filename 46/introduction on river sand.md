What is sand. Sand is a natural unconsolidated granular material. Sand is composed of sand grains which range in size from 1/16 to 2 mm (62.5.2000 micrometers). Sand grains are either mineral particles, rock fragments or biogenic in origin. Finer granular material than sand is referred to as silt. Coarser material is gravel.

## Types of Weathering Withurfussball-essen
The fastest rates of soil formation occur in dune sands in moist environments, where weakly developed soils can develop over decades or centuries. For example, in Macquarie River, alluvium soils classified as Dermosols, Rudosols and Vertosols (see. Pure water at room temperature has a pH of 7.0.

## Sand
Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. Sand has various compositions but is defined by its grain size. Sand grains are smaller than gravel and coarser than silt.Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e., a soil containing more than 85 percent sand-sized particles by mass.. The composition of sand varies, depending on the
