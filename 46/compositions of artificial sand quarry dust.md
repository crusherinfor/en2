## Assessment of Distribution and Composition of Quarry Mine Dust: Case of 
Abstract. The study aimed at assessing the distribution and composition of dust produced at Pomona Stone Quarry mine in Harare, Zimbabwe. The source contribution to ambient PM 2.5 and PM 10 dust levels were quantified and their spatial distribution from the quarry to the receptor (community). The study also analysed the pH of soils around the mine, SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 levels in quarry dust.

The determination of best-packed composition for the quarry dust was associated with the highest dry apparent density . This density was obtained according to the Brazilian NBR 3388 norm [] for 10 different compositions considered in the simplex method, Fig. 1.For each composition, three samples were used to assure statistical validation.

Physical erosion of land occurs when the land gets continuously eroded by various factors without the chemical composition being changed. The rocks reduce in dimension and become smaller. Following that, they get eroded through physical erosion and then form clastic sedimentary rocks.

## Landscaping sand that hardenslegang
Why Bagged Concrete Hardens . Concrete is a building material made by mixing cement, sand, small stones, and water. A bag of ready-to-use concrete, such as Quikrete, is a mix of cement, generally Portland cement, sand, and gravel or stone. Cement is a binding agent. When mixed with water, it creates a paste effectively binding together the sand.
