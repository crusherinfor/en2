## Digging with hand-selbsthilfegruppe
There are three separate gem fossicking areas, composed of different materials (such as sand, rocks and pebbles). You can select from a range of different digging tools and sifting equipment, just like a true outback miner. At the end, there is a washing station so you can choose your favourite crystals and squeeze them into the container

## Hard Rock Garnet - Pallet of 40 x 25kg bags - 80 Mesh
After going through a double cleaning process, the Hard Rock Garnet also has a high level of purity with a very low amount of dust which allows the cutting process to run more smoothly. Hard Rock (Crushed Garnet) will out preform Alluvial (river rock) by 10 to 20% in most applications. Some applications can see as much as a 50% increase in speed.

## equipment to process rock garnet
Only recently has the process by which REEs are incorporated into garnet begun to appear in the literature. Current models of REE uptake in garnet invoke either diffusion-limited (Skora et al. 2006) or reaction-controlled processes (Konrad-Schmolke et al. 2008) but are based on similar observed chemical zoning patterns from similar samples.
