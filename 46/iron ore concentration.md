## Safe carriage of Iron ore & other iron concentrates in bulk
In the carriage of iron ore, the following precautions should be taken: Iron ores are heavy cargoes which occupy a small area for a large weight, ie they have a low stowage factor (between 0.24­0.80 m3/tonne). It is therefore important that the tanktop has sufficient strength to carry certain iron ores. If a bulk carrier loads a homogeneous

## Iron-oxide concretions and nodules | Some Meteorite Information 
Iron-oxide nodules or concretions are the most common kind of meteorwrong sent to us. Hematite and magnetite are two common iron-oxide minerals. Most iron ore deposits consist mainly of hematite, magnetite, or both. Iron-oxide concretions, iron-oxide nodules, and ironstones are often mistaken for meteorites because they are heavy (dense) and their unusual (frequently bizarre!) shapes catch

Concentration refers to the methods of producing ore fractions richer in iron and lower in silica than the original material. Most processes rely on density differences to separate light minerals from heavier ones, so the ore is crushed and ground to release the ore minerals from the gangue.
