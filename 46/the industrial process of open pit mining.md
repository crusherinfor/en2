## The Open-Pit Mining Method Is Used When Large Coal Or Ore Deposits Are 
The Open-pit Mining Method Is Used When Large Coal Or Ore Deposits Are Found _____.? Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.It is applied to ore or rocks found at the surface because the overburden is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunnelling (as would be the case for sand cinder and gravel).

## Evaluation and Risk Analysis of Open-Pit Mining Operations
Mining of raw materials is a process that consists of several stages. In open-pit mining, material with high compressive strength is extracted by drilling and blasting and material with low compressive strength is extracted by e. g. a bucket wheel excavator. Most important influencing factors for crusher decision are compressive strength, moisture content, capacity of crusher, abrasiveness

Open-Pit Mining. Open-pit mining, one of the most common forms, is one of the most damaging. Miners hollow out a section of land, digging down to create a workable area and extract valuable raw materials. This method leaves behind large pits in the earth and can contaminate the groundwater with chemicals used in the mining process.

What is open pit mining . Open pit mines are those mining operations that take place on the surface, unlike the underground mines. This is possible when the reservoir sprouts on the surface or at a very small depth. It began to be realized in the middle of the XVI century and it is used all over the world.
