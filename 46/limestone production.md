## Understanding Limestone in Cement - Concrete Construction
The change is that the specification adds up to 5% limestone. The biggest difference in production is that the limestone is added to the clinker blend before grinding. Because the limestone is softer than the clinker it will grind preferentially, resulting in a cement with a better particle size distribution with less energy.

## Limestone - Its Processing and Application in Iron and  - IspatGuru
Limestone is also a very important industrial mineral. Its chemical properties make it a valuable mineral for a wide range of industrial/manufacturing uses. Limestone is also one of the vital raw materials used in production of iron and steel. Limestone, by definition, is a rock that contains at least 50 % of CaCO3 in the form of calcite by weight.

## Limestone and Dolomite and their Use in Iron and Steel Plant
In ironmaking, limestone and dolomite are used in the production of sinter, pellets, and directly in blast furnace as fluxing materials. In case of steelmaking limestone and dolomite are used as lime or calcined dolomite both in the primary steelmaking (basic oxygen furnace, electric arc furnace), and in the secondary steel making processes

## State wise Production and Distribution of Non-Metallic Minerals in India
Madhya Pradesh is the largest producer of limestone and accounts for over 16 per cent of the total limestone production of India. Large deposits occur in the districts of Jabalpur, Satna, Betul, Sagar, Damoh and Rewa. The total reserves of all grades of limestone are estimated to be over 1,500 million tonnes. 2. Rajasthan:

## Biogenic limestone-based cement promises carbon-zero buildings
Limestone isn't the only product microalgae can create - microalgae's lipids, proteins, sugars, and carbohydrates can be used to produce biofuels, food, and cosmetics, meaning these microalgae could also be a source of other, more expensive co-products - helping to offset the costs of limestone production.
