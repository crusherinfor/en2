A stamp mill is a mechanical device used to separate gold from rocks and ore. It features a number of sizable steel stamps. These stamps are attached to powerful battering arms, which raise and lower the stamps. When the stamps are lowered they come crashing down with a powerful force, crushing the material beneath them.

## Kentucky Mine Historic Park & Museum: Tour a Gold Rush Era Stamp Mill
Details. 7 dollars for a tour (as of 2015) 1 dollar for the museum only. Hours: 10 AM - 4 PM. Open only in the summer. All information from 2015.

## Exploring The Goldome Mill Complex - Living Las Vegas
The Goldome complex seems to have ceased operation by 1998. The lights of the Ivanpah solar Plant can be seen in the distance on the left. The seclusion of the mill site has likely helped protect it from vandals. The name Goldome, means "an abnormal growth of gold;" the suffix "-ome" is a variant of "-oma," usually meaning a tumor.
