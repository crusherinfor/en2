## Grinding machine
A grinding machine, often shortened to grinder, is a power tool (or machine tool) used for grinding.It is a type of machining using an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool.Each grain of abrasive on the wheel's surface cuts a small chip from the workpiece via shear deformation.. Grinding is used to finish workpieces that must show high surface quality (e.g., low surface roughness) and high

Errors will somehow get into all measurements no matter how much care is taken. But it is the responsibility of the person performing the measurement to take proper care so that the errors can be minimized as much as possible. Errors can be broadly classified into 3 categories which are: Random errors. Systematic errors.

## What is a Pump? | What are the types of Pumps - Mechanical Boost
A Pump is a mechanical device that uses to transfer different fluids from one location to another. It is a hydraulic device that lifts fluids from low to high levels, and moves fluids from low to high-pressure areas. The pump transfers fluid by converting the fluid's mechanical energy into pressure energy (hydraulic energy).
