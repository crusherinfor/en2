Quarry Design | Geo-trainings. Mar 15, 2021Â· Description. A Quarry is a type of open-pit mine, they are both surface mining methods but there are some differences between the open pit and the quarry in terms of design . in this you will see what are these differences, and how to design a quarry from start to finish.

## design a open pit quarry
Open pit mines can be used in coal mining, and they are used extensively in "hard rock" mining for ores such as metal ores, copper, gold, iron, aluminum, and many minerals. In a open pit coal mine, the pit bottom would be the bottom mined coal seam elevation, since it is usually feasible to extract multiple seams when surface mining coal.

In mining: Pit geometry divided into horizontal layers called benches. The thickness (that is, the height) of the benches depends on the type of deposit, the mineral being mined, and the equipment being used; for large mines it is on the order of 12 to 15 metres (about 40 to 50 feet).. "/>

Not only do the design criteria directly impact upon the business case [and longevity] of a mine project but also the safety related geotechnical issues, which must be planned for during the design process. The case study presented, is used to illustrate the criteria and considerations of a large open pit design from an operational perspective.
