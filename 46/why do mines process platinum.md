## why do mines process platinum
These are all extracted during the mining process. Because of the rarity of pgm and its tendency to combine with other metals, the mining process often yields far more nickel or copper than it does platinum. In South Africa, the world's largest producer, platinum is mined in an area called the Bushveld Igneous Complex.
