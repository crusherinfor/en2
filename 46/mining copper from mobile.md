The amount of marketable copper produced is small compared to the original material mined. Several hundred metric tons of ore must be handled for each metric ton of

## Infestlings are simply chunks of corrupted growths, the pestilent 
Infestlings are simply chunks of corrupted growths, the pestilent tumours of the land given wings and further life. They bramble mindlessly towards wherever the corruption has not touched.

## Copper | Energy & Mining
Copper is also an integral part of the expanding information technology sector and is used in the manufacture of computers, mobile phones, fax machines and televisions. Copper can occur naturally in its pure state (native copper) but is principally mined as the primary sulfide chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2 ).
