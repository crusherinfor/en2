1) Dredge platforms jerk around a lot as the suction nozzle is managed underwater. The suction hose is flexible, so there is an accordion-affect when varying amounts of suction are used at the nozzle. This causes the dredge to bounce around. The bouncing can throw off critical settings on mechanical recovery equipment.

Vasa or Wasa (Swedish pronunciation: ()) is a Swedish warship built between 1626 and 1628. The ship sank after sailing roughly 1,300 m (1,400 yd) into her maiden voyage on 10 August 1628. She fell into obscurity after most of her valuable bronze cannons were salvaged in the 17th century, until she was located again in the late 1950s in a busy shipping area in Stockholm harbor.

## The Mercury Problem in Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining
The Mercury Problem in Artisanal Gold Mining. Mercury-based artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) causes more mercury pollution than any other human activity. 1 In this practice, mercury metal is used to extract gold from ore as a stable amalgam. The amalgam is then heated to evaporate the mercury and isolate the gold.

major flaw of the gravity separation method is that very fine gold, referred to as flour, flood, or colloidal gold, is lost in processing.

Moissanite is also doubly refractive, unlike diamonds which are singly reactive. This means that light is refracted through the stone in a way that looks doubled, similar to how light refracts in gemstones like zircon and sapphires. It's also almost as hard as a diamond, ranking 9.25/10 instead of 10/10 on the hardness scale..

## Automatic Gold Recovery Electrowinning System - Eco-Goldex
This automatic gold recovery electrowinning system is specially designed for continuous gold recovery from concentrated precious metal pregnant solution. This unit can recover all precious metals (anions) existing in the pregnant solution with the accumulated sequence on the cathode. This base model is suitable for small-scale operations of either e-waste recycling or small gold mine

##  Mercury-Free Gold mining Technologies - Convention on Biological Diversity
tailings generated. Mercury, a dangerous pollutant, is the preferred method employed by small-scale miners for gold recovery. Gold extraction using mercury is comprised of the following four stages: 1) amalgamation, 2) separation of amalgamation, 3) removal of excess mercury, and 4) burning of the remaining amalgam to produce a gold sponge.
