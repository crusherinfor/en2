## The Production Of Iron Ore: What Makes Our Main Product - Vale
Ore is a mineral or a collection of minerals (rock) which may be operated economically. Iron ore, for example, Vale's main product occurs as oxides, carbonates, sulfides and silicates, being the most abundant oxides and greater commercial interest. Our ore, for example, consists mainly of oxides hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4).
