## What can be made from sand?
Believe it or not, glass is made from liquid sand. You can make glass by heating ordinary sand (which is mostly made of silicon dioxide) until it melts and turns into a liquid.  Construction sand and gravel is used to make concrete, for road construction, for mixing with asphalt, as construction fill, and in the production of construction

## How sand is made - material, manufacture, making, history, used 
Specific types of sand are used in the manufacture of glass and as a molding material for metal casting. Other sand is used as an abrasive in sandblasting and to make sandpaper. Sand was used as early as 6000 B.C. to grind and polish stones to make sharpened tools and other objects. The stones were rubbed on a piece of wetted sandstone to hone

## From sand to flat glass | glassonweb
Sand is critical to flat glass manufacturing since it is the principal source of silicon dioxide (SiO2) which is essential for producing glass [2]. A high proportion of silica in the sand composition (above 95%) is therefore required together with a high level of chemical purity. This quality of raw materials is all the more important for flat

## Borosilicate glass
Borosilicate glass is a type of glass with silica and boron trioxide as the main glass-forming constituents. Borosilicate glasses are known for having very low coefficients of thermal expansion (≈3 × 10 −6 K −1 at 20 °C), making them more resistant to thermal shock than any other common glass. Such glass is subjected to less thermal stress and can withstand temperature differentials
