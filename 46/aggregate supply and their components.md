## Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Effects of Covid-19: A Real-time 
We extract aggregate demand and supply shocks for the US economy from real-time survey data on inflation and real GDP growth using a novel identification scheme. Our approach exploits non-Gaussian features of macroeconomic forecast revisions and imposes minimal theoretical assumptions. After verifying that our results for US post-war business

## Fluctuations in Aggregate Demand and Supply | CFA Level 1 - AnalystPrep
Increase of aggregate demand leads to higher employment and the economic expansion of real GDP. If the economic expansion takes the economy ahead of its production capacity, it will lead to inflation. Increased government spending, a decline in taxes, and an increase in money supply will shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.

## Lecture Notes -- Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply - Econweb
Demand for goods and services is less than production of goods and services, and firms see inventories increasing unexpectedly. They respond by decreasing production and prices. As the price level falls, Aggregate Demand increases and Aggregate Supply decreases. Again, the economy tends towards equilibrium.
