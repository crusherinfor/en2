## Quartz | Properties, Varieties, Occurrence and Uses - Geology Science
Quartz occurs as an important constituent of those igneous rocks which have an excess of silica, such as granite, rhyolite, pegmatite. It is extremely resistant to both mechanical and chemical attack, and thus the breakdown of igneous rocks containing it yields quartz grains which may accumulate and form the sedimentary rock sandstone.

What is Quartz? Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in the Earth's crust. It comes in many different varieties. Amethyst, citrine, and agate are just a few popular gem forms of quartz.. In the most basic sense, quartz is the crystalline form of silicon dioxide. When quartz grows into large crystals, lapidaries can cut varieties such as rock crystal, smoky quartz, amethyst, or citrine.
