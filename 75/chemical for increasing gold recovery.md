As can be seen, the Au recovery is strongly affected by the leaching time. It can be seen that the leaching time has the most influence on gold leaching. In addition, the recovery of gold reduces with increasing pH in the range investigated. It is obvious that the high gold recovery is achieved at the highest leaching time and the lowest pH value.

## Enhancing gold recovery from refractory bio-oxidised gold  - AusIMM
Among all parameters, the 20 min activation yielded the most gold recovery (~1.8 times increase). The mechano-chemical activation mechanism was, therefore, ascribed to gold surface cleaning, creation of pores/crevices that are linked to gold sites, and disintegration of gold-gangue mineral agglomerates that encapsulated gold particles.
