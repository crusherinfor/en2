The earliest iron mining and use was by Paleo-Indians in the Sunrise area, in southeast Wyoming for iron oxide pigment between 8,000 and 13,000 years ago. In the late 1800s, Wyoming produced concretionary hematite from the Rawlins area for use as paint pigment and smelting flux. Titaniferous magnetite, identified prior to 1850, has been mined

By 2009, South Africa's share of world gold production had dropped to less than 8%. Mining in the Witwatersrand Basin is accomplished by creating deep underground tunnels that are necessary to reach the plentiful reserves. The Tau Tona Mine features the deepest tunnel in the world extending a full 2.4 miles below the earth's surface.

Skarn deposits are one of the more abundant ore types in the earth's crust and form in rocks of almost all ages. Skarn is a relatively simple rock type defined by a mineralogy usually dominated by calcsilicate minerals such as garnet and pyroxene.
