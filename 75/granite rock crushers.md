## Decomposed granite
Decomposed granite is a kind of granite rock that is weathered to the point that the parent material readily fractures into smaller pieces of weaker rock. Further weathering yields material that easily crumbles into mixtures of gravel-sized particles known as grus that further may break down to produce a mixture of clay and silica sand or silt particles.
