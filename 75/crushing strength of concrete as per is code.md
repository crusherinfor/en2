Calculation. Compressive Strength of concrete = Maximum compressive load / Cross Sectional Area. Cross sectional Area = 150mm X 150mm = 22500 mm2 or 225 cm2. Assume the compression load is 450 KN, Compressive Strength = (450000 N / 225)/9.81 = 204 kg/cm2. Note - 1 kg is equal to 9.81 N.

While traditional concrete normally has a compressive strength ranging anywhere from 2,500 to 5,000 psi, UHPC can have a compressive strength of up to 10 times that of traditional concrete. After just 14 days of curing, UHPC has a compressive strength of 20,000 psi. This number increases to 30,000 psi when fully cured for 28 days.
