## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.  A cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating

First, cone crushers cannot accept all material sizes. Any material fed to the crusher must be pre-sized for that particular crusher (usually 200mm or less).
