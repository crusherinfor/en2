## Quarrying methods: an international comparison | Stone World
The bulk of the cutting is done with Micheletti diamond wire saws, which are also used for final block trimming at the quarry site. Production at Tino's quarry for Macael White marble currently stands at 700 cubic meters of stone per month. The stone blocks produced are relatively small, measuring 4 cubic meters or even as small as 2 cubic meters.
