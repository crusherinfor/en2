## Coal mining in the UK: Where mines are still being operated and planned
West Lothian, Scotland. The Rusha coal mine by Banks Group began extracting coal from the site in 2012. It had planned to extract about 1.5 million tonnes of coal over its 154 hectares. The site had 150 employees and traffic movements of up to 63 coal wagons a day. Restoration of the site has now commenced.

## Coal Mines in the Industrial Revolution - History Learning Site
Before the Industrial Revolution, two types of mines existed: drift mines and bell pits. Both were small-scale coal mines and the coal which came from these type of pits was used locally in homes and local industry. However, as the country started to industrialise itself, more and more coal was needed to fuel steam engines and furnaces.

Between 1880 and 1920, southern West Virginia's population grew from 93,000 to 446,000, due almost entirely to the coal industry. The region's first coal miners primarily were African Americans, both enslaved and free. By 1850, approximately half of Kanawha County's slaves worked in the salt industry—many mined coal to fuel the furnaces.
