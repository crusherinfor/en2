## Coal Mining in Africa - SG
Jun 4, 2021Coal mining in Africa is still a profitable industry. While many countries move away from fossil fuels, mining production in Africa continues to rise. Much of the continent's coal comes from South Africa, which accounts for roughly 85% of production. In this article, we'll look at some of the main coal mines in Africa and how this industry affects the continent's economy.
