The starting point for ball mill media and solids charging generally starts as follows: 50% media charge. Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non-spherical, irregularly shaped and mixed-size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space. Add to this another 10%-15% above the ball charge for total of 23%
