Limestone rocks fall under the category of sedimentary rocks that are made from mineral calcite. This rock is used to make concrete and is an excellent building stone for humid regions. Limestone, chemical formula CaCO3, is a white, chalky solid in most conditions. As a sedimentary rock, it will usually contain fossils of ancient creatures.

Jun 25, 2022Limestone is a type of sedimentary rock which is primarily composed of carbonate of magnesium and calcium (dolomite) or calcium carbonate (calcite). It is mainly composed of shell fragments, fossilized debris and other tiny fossils. Physically, Limestone is quite impervious, hard, compact, fine to very fine grained calcareous rock.

A quarry is a place where rocks, sand, or minerals are extracted from the surface of the Earth.A quarry is a type of mine called an open-pit mine, because it is open to the Earth's surface. Another type of mine, a sub-surface mine, consists of underground tunnels or shafts.. The most common purpose of quarries is to extract stone for building materials. .
