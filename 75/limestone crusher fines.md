## Proper base layer for interlocking stone - Fine Homebuilding
A foot of base for sure on a driveway, but don't use a foot of 5/8 or 3/4. Start with 2 inch crusher, or even 2" recycled concrete. When you get 8-10 inches in, switch to 1" or 3/4". We use 1/2 inch galv. pipe for screed guides. Screed the 1", tamp one more time, then use the same pipe for screeding the sand.
