The preparation of high-purity quartz is mainly through chemical synthesis, natural crystal processing and deep purification of quartz minerals. However, because the preparation of chemical synthesis and natural crystal processing is restricted by raw materials, cost, output, etc., it is difficult for large-scale industrial application.

By increasing the use of organic acids, harmful effects of H 2 SO 4 can be reduced.. By using oxalic acid with H 2 SO 4, environment-friendly process, higher efficiency. Economic modeling was performed by SuperPro Design
