Apr 9, 2021To accelerate the curing process, steam or oven can be used. Once this process is completed, the produced slabs will undergo gauging, calibrating, polishing, and then prep up for the packing process. 5) Cooling. After curing, the slabs are held upright with the help of a clamp and cooled for 24-36 hours. 6) Trimming.

The preparation of high-purity quartz is mainly through chemical synthesis, natural crystal processing and deep purification of quartz minerals. However, because the preparation of chemical synthesis and natural crystal processing is restricted by raw materials, cost, output, etc., it is difficult for large-scale industrial application.

High-purity quartz (1 ppm Fe 2 O 3 content) by using hydrometallurgical process. Reducing agents (oxalic, citric acid, glucose) were used to increase Fe 2 O 3 removal.. By increasing the use of organic acids, harmful effects of H 2 SO 4 can be reduced.. By using oxalic acid with H 2 SO 4, environment-friendly process, higher efficiency. Economic modeling was performed by SuperPro Design
