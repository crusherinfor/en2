## Why the world is demanding more cobalt, and why new methods for cobalt 
Current Mining Methods for Cobalt Production: Cobalt is found primarily with mineral deposits of nickel and copper in the Earth. There are many different cobalt ores that are mined, involving many steps of separation and purification. The most well-known and mined ores are: nickel cobalt sulfide, copper cobalt sulfide, copper cobalt oxide
