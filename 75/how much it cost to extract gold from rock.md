This is where the problem lies with a lot of gold miners. More than 10% of gold mined is lost in this 100 year old cyanide solution using activated carbon. This comes at a huge cost for big producers like Agnico, Kinross and TMAC. A 200k oz/year producer could lose over $26 million annually just lost in cyanide solution and carbon particles.

Gold ore can be obtained in various ways. It can be smelted into bars of gold ingots. Gold rocks naturally generate on the Buffalkor Island and the Diamond Mines. Mining a gold rock yields 2 - 3 gold ores per stage, resulting in a total of 4 - 6 gold ores. There's also a 10% chance the rock drops crystallized gold.

The price of gold is up by around 50% since 2016, and it's hovering near the all-time high of $2,000/oz. That's good news for gold miners, who achieved record-high profit margins in 2020. For every ounce of gold produced in 2020, gold miners pocketed $828 on average, significantly higher than the previous high of $666/oz set in 2011.

## Gold extraction
Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e., gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as colour) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calaverite (AuTe), aurostibnite

These numbers report that the cost of extracting an ounce of gold is actually over $1,000 per ounce, well above the aforementioned numbers. And since gold is currently trading at just over $1,200 per ounce, it explains why mining companies have had less-than-stellar profits. Determining the costs of mining largely depend on the region as well.
