Treadmills. A treadmill is a type of exercise equipment that consists of a durable deck or belt that lets users run or jog in continuous motion. It usually has shorter handlebars and a security key that you can attach to your waist as a safety feature. A treadmill is great for an aerobic workout or even high-intensity interval training.
