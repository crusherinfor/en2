Sudan ALITMAD700tpd Gold Ore Processing Plant Xinhai. Gold CIL (Carbon in Leach) Process is an efficient design of extracting and recovering gold from its ore. By cyaniding and carbon leaching crushed gold ore slurry simultaneously, CIL process lower the gold mining operation cost and increase gold recovery rate to a degree of 99%.

Carbon-in leach (CIL) is a simultaneous leach and absorption process. The simultaneous leach and absorption phases of the CIL process were developed for processing gold ores that contain preg-robbing materials such as natural absorptive carbon. These reduce the gold yield by attracting gold meant for the activated carbon.

Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.. Introduced in the early 1980s, Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process. As such it is used in most industrial applications where the presence of competing silver or copper does not prohibit its use.

With carbon-in-column operation, the gold cyanide solution flows through a series of fluidised bed columns in an up-flow configuration. Fluidised bed carbon columns can process solutions that contain as much as 2 to 3 wt% solids, thus making them well suited for heap leach applications which are often high in solids content.

## USA1 - Gold recovery from carbon - Google Patents
A method of recovering gold from carbon fines in a resin-in-leach process wherein the fines are contacted with an ion exchange resin, in the presence of a suitable lixiviant, to load gold onto the resin, eluting the gold from the resin using a suitable eluent and recovering the gold from a resulting eluate.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.
