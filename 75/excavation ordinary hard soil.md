The air knife is an increasingly leveraged tool at various types of construction sites because of its ability to excavate in an effective yet non-destructive way. Using a high-pressure airflow, the air knife works to safely penetrate and loosen ground soil, which is then vacuumed into a debris tank for later backfilling or disposal.

The refractory mortar is utilized only to build fire places and shall not be applied on hot faces. Mortar, which is a mixture of water, cement, and sand, has a higher water-to cement ratio than concrete. It has a thicker consistency which makes it a great adhesive and bonding agent for bricks and tiles. Use kaowool or at least something like perlite, shred styrofoam or straw.

## Excavation - Health Safety & Environment
If the soil breaks into clumps that are hard to break into smaller clumps, it may be clay combined with gravel, sand, or silt. Thumb penetration test: This test roughly estimates the unconﬁned compressive strength of a sample. Press your thumb into the soil sample. If the sample resists hard pressure it may be type A soil.

The excavated soil can be used to create a berm around the biological filter, and its size should be equivalent to the size of the pond. In other words, if the pond is 11-by-16 and 2 feet deep, the berm should be 11-by-16 and 2 feet high. If the biological filter is set higher, more soil will be needed to disguise it, and it may seem out of
