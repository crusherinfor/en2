At the Xingdong coal mine, there is a highway near the point of the grouting. In order to grout on the side of the road, it was necessary to drill under the road without affecting the subgrade. The depth of the lowest point of the borehole below the surface is 1350 m; the depth limitation of the borehole was 2311 m in 2019 (Yao et al. 2019 ).

Coal is a black or brownish-black sedimentary rock that can be burned for fuel and used to generate electricity.It is composed mostly of carbon and hydrocarbons, which contain energy that can be released through combustion (burning). Coal is the largest source of energy for generating electricity in the world, and the most abundant fossil fuel in the United States.

The difference lies in the use of a more sophisticated machine, known as a highwall miner. The highwall miner shares some common elements with a continuous mining machine.

Missouri was admitted to the union in 1821, making it the second state within the LouisianaTerritory. Missouri began mining coal in the 1840s and was the first commercial coal mining state west of the Mississippi River. Most of the early mines were underground and have since been abandoned. Surface mining didn't start in Missouri until the 1930s.
