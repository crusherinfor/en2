## basalt or obsidian? : geology - reddit
Obsidian is volcanic glass (meaning it has no crystals) and consists primarily of silica (with just enough impurities to color it), whereas basalt is a low-silica, high iron/magnesium igneous rock entirely made of small crystals of various minerals, including plagioclase feldspar and usually pyroxene and/or amphibole. level 2.

The most significant difference between granite and marble is its absorbency. The marble is laxer and more absorbent than granite. Granite, whose crystalline structure makes it more resistant to staining, abrasion, and discolouration, is, in fact, the hardest of all-natural stones. It may be damaged by cleaning liquids.

This is where the concept of a "magma chamber" comes in - the subsurface source of liquid rock to feed an extrusive volcanic event. In simple terms, gabbro is just the cooled magma chamber for the basaltic flows that erupt at the surface. In the same respect, granite is the cooled (and exposed) magma chamber for extrusive rhyolite.
