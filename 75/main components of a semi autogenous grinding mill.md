## A Dynamic Model for a Class of Semi-Autogenous Mill Systems
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a state space model of semi-autogenous (SAG) mill systems, which is of great significance to the mineral processing control. According to the practical enterprise production condition, the model is composed of two main parts. One is the ore circuit model. Compared with other models of ore circuit, the present model is simple and efficient.

## Plastic shrinkage and drying shrinkaged.shop
The shrinkage of plastics signifies the volume contraction of polymers during the cooling step of the processing of polymers. This contraction is partly due to the difference of density of polymers from the melt state and the cooled, rigid state. Most of the plastic molded part shrinkage occurs in the mold while cooling.

The increase in throughput is generally ascribed to the increase in the grate apertures and the increase in mill volume due to the wear of these components. Whilst the decrease in product size is attributed to the reduction in lifter height and angle, resulting in more breakage by means of attrition and abrasion.
