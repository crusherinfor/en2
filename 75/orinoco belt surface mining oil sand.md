## Orinoco Belt
Oil reserves. The Orinoco Belt consists of large deposits of extra heavy crude.Venezuela's heavy oil deposits of about 1,200 billion barrels (1.9 × 10 11 m 3), found primarily in the Orinoco Petroleum Belt, are estimated to approximately equal the world's reserves of lighter oil. Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. has estimated that the producible reserves of the Orinoco Belt are up to 235 billion

A Caterpillar 797 truck used in the extraction of oil sands for hauling the extracted sand. [1] Surface mining is a technique used to obtain bitumen from oil sands where the oil sands deposits are located fairly close to the surface. If the reserves are shallow enough, earth moving equipment can dig out oil sand for processing.

Abstract. The origins and logging responses of flushed zones in some blocks of Orinoco heavy oil belt, Venezuela are still unclear. To solve this issue, we examined the conventional logging, nuclear magnetic resonance logging, fluid viscosity, core analysis and oil field production data comprehensively to find out the logging responses and origins of the flushed zones.

## May 1 Surface Mining Techniques used in the Oil Sands
Oil sands mining operations are some of the largest mines in the world.  Less than 20% of Alberta's bitumen reserves are close enough to the surface to be mined. Mined oil sands deposits are normally less than 50 meters below the surface but can be as deep as 75 meters below grade. Anything deeper cannot be economically mined since too much

The environmental impact of the oil sands is an issue that has been extremely divisive.

Although some steps are being taken to reduce the severity of these impacts - such as reclamation - there are still associated

Total Water Use. In 2020, just over one billion cubic metres (m 3) of water was used to produce about 604 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) from oil sands mining, down from 2019 production of 630 million BOE (see the following figure).
