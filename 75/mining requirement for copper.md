Classic Mining Leveling. Every starter zone is filled with Copper Ore, it doesn't really matter which one you choose.. Night Elf players have to wait until they get to Darkshore before they can start leveling mining because Teldrassil doesn't have any Copper Ore..

## Water requirements of the copper industry - USGS
The copper industry in 1955 used about 330 million gallons of water per day in the mining and manufacturing of primary copper. This amount is about 0.3 percent of the total estimated withdrawals of industrial water in the United States in 1955. These facts were determined by a survey, in 1956, of the amount and chemical quality of the water

## Mining and the Environment: What Happens When A Mine Closes?
Mining activities increase the volume and rate of exposure of sulfur-containing rocks to air and water, creating sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. This acid run-off dissolves heavy metals such as copper, lead and mercury which leach into ground water aquifers and surface water sources, harming humans and wildlife.

Copper miners are able to reduce specific energy requirements, averaging 22 GJ/t Cu, but it still remains higher than other metals such as steel, averaging 20 GJ/t. Declining ore grades and increasing extraction complexity is increasing overall energy demand, pushing miners to look for more energy-efficient technologies.

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels, called adits, to reach the ore. Underground mining is, however, relatively expensive and is
