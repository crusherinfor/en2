## Specific Heat Capacity Measurement - Mettler Toledo
Specific heat capacity units are usually joules per gram-kelvin, or J/gK. To calculate a material's heat capacity, the following equation applies: cp = q / (m ∙ ∆ T) Where c p = specific heat, m = mass in grams, q = the energy lost or gained, and ∆T = change in temperature. Topics overview:

## How to Calculate Production Capacity | Bizfluent
The first step in understanding production capacity is to calculate the machine-hour capacity of the factory or manufacturing plant. For example, say that a plant has 50 machines and workers can use the machines from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m., or for 16 hours a day.

## Graph coloring-based approach for railway station design analysis and 
In this study, we focus on a capacity analysis for railway stations. Stations, as nodes in a railway network, commonly tend to be bottlenecks, limiting the capacity of the entire network (Yuan & Hansen, 2004). The capacity of stations is mainly affected by the characteristics of the traffic pattern, station infrastructure, and interlocking system.

Product design will affect the people that buy the item, which affects the producer's capacity.

## Notes on Capacity Planning - Importance, Procedure, Determinants
Capacity planning is important due to the following reasons: 1. Capacity limits the rate of output. Therefore, capacity planning determines the ability of an enterprise to meet future demand for its products and services. 2. Capacity influences the operating costs. Capacity is determined on the basis of estimated demand.
