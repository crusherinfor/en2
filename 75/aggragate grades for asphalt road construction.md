Asphalt Rock. Asphalt has many different type of mixes. A mix for the base layer of the road is comprised of much larger rock than the smaller aggregates in the finished layer on the top of an asphalt driving surface. Simon specializes in making all of the needed mixes for all asphalt paving projects.

## Asphalt Concrete - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Jun-Feng Su, in Eco-Efficient Pavement Construction Materials, 2020. 11.1 Introduction. Asphalt concrete is one of the most common types of pavement surface materials used in the world. It is a porous material made at a very high temperature of about 180°C that consists of mixture of asphalt binder (bitumen), aggregate particles, and air voids.

## Asphalt Millings Vs Gravel Driveway - Bovees, where the growing begins!
Come hail or shine, heat or extreme cold, recycled asphalt can take it. If you live in a place where you experience cold winters with loads of snow and ice, an asphalt surface is much better. It produces less formation of ice on the surface and also allows for snow to melt faster than on a gravel driveway or road.

Meanwhile, of the almost 1 billion tons of sand and gravel produced, 24% was used in road construction, 12% in asphalt, and 44% in concrete. Why are aggregates important? Not only are aggregates the building blocks of our society, they are also prevalent in our daily lives. The average American requires roughly 10,000 tons of aggregate per year.

Therefore, the volume of asphalt = L x B x W = 2000 x 8 x 0.15 (15 cm = 0.15 m) = 2400 m3. Here, density of asphalt is taken as 2330 kg/m3. Therefore, quantity of asphalt = volume of road section x density of asphalt. = 2400 x 2330 = 559200 kg = 5592 tons (dividing by 1000) Go through the following video, to get the detailed process.
