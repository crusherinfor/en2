## MILLING AND TURNING: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? | Winn Machine
The milling tool is rotating rather than the piece being shaped. In fact, this is the major difference between milling and turning. The milling process keeps the workpiece stationary while the tool moves around the X, Y, and Z axes of the piece. Machinists use milling in different ways from a secondary process for an already-manufactured part

## What is the Difference Between Turning, Drilling and Milling Operations 
Drilling produces a round hole in a workpiece. A tapping or drill press machine performs drilling operations. However, drilling can also be handled with a milling machine. When machining a workpiece, chips are the waste material produced during the machining process. The way the drill bit is shaped enables chips to fall away from the workpiece.

As the milling cutter rotates, it presses against the surface of the workpiece, essentially grinding away some of its material in that area. Face milling and peripheral milling follow the same concept by using a rotating milling cutter to remove material from a workpiece. The way in which they perform this task, however, varies.
