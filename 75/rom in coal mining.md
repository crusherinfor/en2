silica dust is one of the sources of health risks in surface mines. A variety of respiratory diseases and other ailments, including silicosis and other non-malignant respiratory diseases, may be caused by exposure to respirable silica dust. The Mine Act of 1977 requires the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) to inspect mines every year.

## Coal blending
Coal blending is the process of mixing coals after coal has been mined to achieve quality attributes that are desirable for the coal's intended application (e.g. steam generation, coking). The quality attributes that are most important in blending will differ from one mine site to another and also depend on how the coal seams vary in quality and their final intended use.
