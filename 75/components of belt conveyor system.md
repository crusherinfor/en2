## How Do Conveyor Belts Work? | Belt Functions, Uses & Applications - SEMCOR
However, many conveyor systems rely on a frame with a belt and possible support rollers to carry materials and products efficiently. All conveyor systems have three main components — the aluminum profile, the driving unit and the extremity unit. In a conveyor belt system, the aluminum profile consists of the frame, belt and any supports.
