A Dressing of Stone :- After quarrying, Stones are to be dressed for finish surface. The stone dressing can be done easily just after quarrying. The stone blocks are cut and squared as per requirements with the help of dressing tools. There are many types of tools uses for the dressing of stones such as pitching tools, mason's hammer, club

Granite quarrying. Granite is a type of rock formed deep below the earth´s surface from slowly cooling magma. Large machinery is brought in to extract (or quarry) the granite from open-pit mines using wire saws or diamond wire saws. Quality control already starts here. After quarrying, much of the stone is sold in blocks, and that which is cut

A quarry is essentially a type of mine that is used to extract stones and such that will be repurposed into building materials. Quarries belong to a group of mines called open pit mines.The reasoning for this name resides in the fact that these mines are open to Earth's surface. Quarries in Massachusetts are no different than your average quarry.

Quarrying. Although seldom used to form entire structures, stone is greatly valued for its aesthetic appeal, durability, and ease of maintenance. The most popular types include granite, limestone, sandstone, marble, slate, gneiss, and serpentine.All natural stone used for structural support, curtain walls, veneer, floor tile, roofing, or strictly ornamental purposes is called building stone
