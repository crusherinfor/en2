## Our Operations - Lubambe
Lubambe is a large-scale operating underground copper mine. The Mine sits on a tenement area of approximately 228km2, which is part of the Konkola Musoshi Basin, located within Zambia's Copperbelt Province which hosts one of the largest copper deposits in the world. The mineralization is argillite-hosted, grading between 1.5-15% TCu and

Copper Leaching Practices. For centuries small amounts of copper have been recovered from acid mine-drainage waters. In recent years, the expansion of copper-bearing waste dump leaching for copper recovery has established a technological basis that is rapidly converting the art of copper leaching into a science.

Terence Bell. Updated on November 25, 2019. The world's 20 largest copper mines produce nearly 9 million metric tons of the precious metal a year, about 40% of the world's total copper mine capacity. Chile and Peru, alone, account for more than half of the copper mines on this list. The U.S. makes the cut, as well, with two mines among the top 20.

Iron and sulfur are converted to oxides and are removed in either the gas stream or the slag (the latter being recycled for the recovery of remaining values), leaving a " blister" copper containing between 98.5 and 99.5 percent copper and up to 0.8 percent oxygen. The converter is rotated for skimming the slag and pouring the blister copper.

## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing - GREAT MINING
Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.

Aug 1, 2022Ores that contain copper in the U.S. are typically mined in large, open-pits. Copper processing facilities are usually located near mining or extraction sites. Significant waste volumes are associated with copper production. Mine wastes may contain radionuclides due to their natural presence in ores and can be a source of TENORM.

Prospecting and exploration are precursors to mining and often occur simultaneously; together, they can take two to eight years to complete, and may cost from $500,000 to $15 million overall. Prospecting is the process of searching the region for mineral deposits. Historically, prospectors would explore a region on foot with a pick and shovel.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to Know
The Basics of Copper Mining and Processing. Mined from open pits, copper ore must be crushed as part of the process that occurs between extraction and production. Using today's compact mining equipment, copper ore is extracted from the mine. After the ore is crushed, it's roasted, which helps to convert sulfides to oxides.

Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors..
