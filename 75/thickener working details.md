## What is the Sludge Thickening Process in Water Treatment?
Sludge thickening is important because it is the process used in wastewater treatment centers to increase the solids concentration and decrease the free water. This step minimizes the load on the downstream processes, such as sludge dewatering and digestion. There's more to this process of course, and this article highlights how sludge

## What is a thickener?
How does a sludge thickener work? Thickening is the first step for reducing the sludge volume by removal of free sludge water. Thin sludge is concentrated to thick sludge. Thick sludge has a higher viscosity, but must still be pumpable. Sludge settles in gravity thickeners and is compressed by the weight of its own solids.

Wood flour is used as a filler to thicken epoxy resin. It is made from finely ground wood particles and helps to create a strong, durable bond between the epoxy resin and the substrate. Wood flour can also be used to fill in any gaps or cracks in the surface before coating with epoxy resin. This will help to ensure a smooth, even finish.
