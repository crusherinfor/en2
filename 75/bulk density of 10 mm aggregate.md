## Bulk Density - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Bulk density (BD) is the dry weight of the solid per unit volume of the solid. It was determined by obtaining the amount of water displaced in a beaker using the Archimedes principle. It can be calculated as. A bulk density of 0.96 was obtained for membrane MB1, 1.06 for membrane MB2, and 1.391 for membrane MB3.

## Bulk Density of Aggregate - CivilNotePpt
The bulk density of an aggregate may be defined as the mass of the material in a given volume. It depends on how densely the aggregate is packed. The other factors affecting the bulk density are the particle size & shape, the grading of the aggregate and moisture content. Bulk density of aggregate is generally expressed as kg/litre.
