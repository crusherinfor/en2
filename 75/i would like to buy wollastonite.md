The problem with both products is that they aren't targeted so every insect/bug gets hit with it. Supposedly, wollastonite works better than diatomaceous earth but that's up for debate.

WOLLASTONITE (Data in metric tons unless otherwise noted) Domestic Production and Use: Wollastonite was mined by two companies in New York during 2020. U.S. production of wollastonite (sold or used by producers) was withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data but was estimated to have remained essentially unchanged from that of 2019.

## Wollastonite - Mineral Properties, Photos and Occurrence
Wollastonite looks very similar to other fibrous white minerals, especially if they occur in the form of sprays and fans of thin needle-shaped crystals. There are numerous pale colored fibrous minerals, which could possibly look like wollastonite. However, most of them occurs in completely different geological environment and/or is quite rare.

## Wollastonite
Wollastonite is a calcium inosilicate mineral (Ca Si O 3) that may contain small amounts of iron, magnesium, and manganese substituting for calcium. It is usually white. It forms when impure limestone or dolomite is subjected to high temperature and pressure, which sometimes occurs in the presence of silica-bearing fluids as in skarns or in contact with metamorphic rocks.
