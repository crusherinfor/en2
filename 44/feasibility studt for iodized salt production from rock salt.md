Objective: To draft out the simplified scheme of iodized salt monitoring program to compare with the current scheme, and to study its feasibility. Methods: 8 counties from 4 provinces were selected at different coverage rate of iodized salt. Conduct the monitoring program using the current scheme and the simplified scheme, then compare the results.
