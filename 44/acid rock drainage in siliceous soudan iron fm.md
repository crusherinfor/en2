## What the Heck Is Acid Drainage, and Why Is It Such a Big Deal?
Other methods follow a similar tack, covering the rock in various materials to keep it from reacting with the air. There are also more complicated methods of preventing acid rock drainage, involving adding chemicals, bacteria, or bacteria-like organisms to the rock to remove the sulphates before they can react with the air and produce the acid.

##  Technical Document: Acid Mine Drainage Prediction - US EPA
Acid Mine Drainage Prediction compares acid rock drainage factors of waste rock piles and tailings impoundments. In examining this table, it is important to note that diffusion of oxygen into water is slow and, therefore, oxidation of iron sulfide is inhibited until the water level drops, which can occur periodically or seasonally in some cases.

## General Information on Metal Leaching and Acid Rock Drainage
The acid in ARD can leach metals from surrounding rocks causing drainage that has high amounts of dissolved metals (such as iron, aluminum, copper, lead, silver, zinc). This is called metal leaching (ML). Other metals can also be leached from react in non-acidic drainage (such as selenium, zinc, molybdenum, nickel, arsenic and antimony).

## Acid Rock Drainage as Related to Permafrost, Glaciers, and Climate 
Acid rock drainage has become a major topic with respect to mining and the environment in permafrost regions, most notably Canada and Alaska. Climate changes provide major shifts in rainfall, and the rising or lowering of surface water or groundwater levels has affected acid rock drainage generation.

Those siliceous rocks composed of an exceptionally high amount of crystalline siliceous material, mainly the mineral quartz (especially microcrystalline quartz and fibrous chalcedony) and amorphous opal, are most commonly known as chert.

## Acid Rock Drainage as Related to Permafrost, Glaciers, and Climate 
The effects of climate change are showing up in a variety of worldwide environments, resulting in a potential for more pyrite oxidation. With global climate changes occurring, many mountain glaciers in areas with unmined ore bodies on the surface have been retreating, exposing new surfaces of iron sulfide rocks to the atmosphere, creating acid rock drainage (ARD).

## Acid Rock Drainage - Acid Rock and Acid Mine Drainage.
Acid rock drainage is a natural process that occurs at a very slow rate, deep under the earths surface where the Iron sulfide minerals that cause acid rock drainage can barely interact with the atmosphere and water.  These Iron Sulphides can occur in many forms of minerals such as Pyrite (FeS2), Chalcopyrite, Galena, Lead Sulphides

## Acid Mine Drainage - Socio and Environmental Impacts
Pyrite oxidation leads to the formation of dissolved iron, Sulphate, and Hydrogen. When these mine waters with very high acidic pH are used for certain irrigation purposes, these acidic waters are uptake by plants and different crops which results in dangerous health risks to people and animals who consume these contaminated agricultural products (Kuyucak (2001)).

## Acid Mine Drainage and the Techniques to Cleanup this Issue
Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) is created by groundwater that travels through mines and then rejoins the watershed, polluting it. AMD is an urgent environmental issue in mining regions as it makes the affected water uninhabitable, devastating the ecosystem. Current cleanup systems use inexpensive limestone beds to remove the metals and neutralize the pH.

## How does mine drainage occur? | U.S. Geological Survey
Mine drainage is formed when pyrite (an iron sulfide) is exposed and reacts with air and water to form sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can precipitate to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage. The acid runoff further dissolves heavy metals such as copper, lead, and

##  How does Acid Rock Drainage start? - Alaska Community Action On Toxics
• Acid rock drainage may be found at coal mines, hard rock mines, or construction sites that disturb sulfide rock.  Ferric iron is able to act on sulfide rock to make much more acid than natural weathering, and will act even where no oxygen is present, such as under water. When this reaction occurs, pH often drops to 2, and in some places
