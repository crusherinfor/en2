Moreover, adjacent eco-systems are affected by noise, dust, pollution and contaminated water. Pits and quarries disrupt the existing movement of surface water and groundwater; they interrupt natural water recharge and can lead to reduced quantity and quality of drinking water for residents and wildlife near or downstream from a quarry site.

Mining also creates knock-on effects — like water pollution, air pollution and vegetation loss as a result of soil eruption. This can lead to greater habitat loss beyond the immediate location. Habitat Destruction Caused By Mining Habitats can be restored after mining operations are finished, but some impacts will linger.

Aboriginal Australians have lived in the Melbourne area for at least 40,000 years. When European settlers arrived in the 19th century, at least 20,000 Kulin people from three distinct language groups - the Wurundjeri, Bunurong and Wathaurong - resided in the area. It was an important meeting place for the clans of the Kulin nation alliance and a vital source of food and water.

## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Mining Industry?
Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes. The leakage of chemicals from mining sites can also have detrimental effects on the health of the population living at or around the mining site.

Mining subsidence is the surface impact of collapsing overlying strata into mined-out voids. Subsidence may manifest itself in the form of sinkholes or troughs. Sinkholes are usually associated with the collapse of a portion of a mine. Sinkholes or depressions interrupt surface water drainage patterns, affecting ponds, streams, and wetlands.
