## Equipment condition monitoring through fluids analysis
Testing of in-service fluids in operating equipment is optimally geared for predictive maintenance and proactive maintenance. When performed properly testing will optimize planned maintenance and scheduled downtime. The activity is meant to compliment other predictive maintenance tools such as vibration analysis, thermography, and ultrasound.
