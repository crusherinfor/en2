## ASTM C136 - Sieve Analysis of Fine and Coarse Aggregates
Scope. This test method covers the determination of the particle size distribution of fine and coarse aggregates by sieving. Some specifications for aggregates which reference this test method contain grading requirements including both coarse and fine fractions. Instructions are included for sieve analysis of such aggregates.

3. Coarse Aggregates After the material has been sieved, remove each tray, weigh each size, and record each weight to the nearest 0.1 g. Be sure to remove any aggregate trapped within the sieve openings by gently working from either or both sides with a trowel or piece of flat metal until the aggregate is freed. Banging the sieve on the floor or

After completion of sieving, then weigh the aggregates retained in each sieve & note it down. Coarse aggregates. Take 1kg of the coarse aggregate test sample. Arrange the IS sieve in descending 25mm,20mm 12.5mm, 10mm, 4.75mm. Now fill the sample to the highest sieve and sieve well for up to 10 minutes.
