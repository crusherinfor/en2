Features & Benefits. A Cone Crusher will deliver a 4:1 to 6:1 reduction ratio. As we set the closed side setting tighter to create a finer output, we also reduce the volume or throughput capacity of the machine. Generally speaking, multiplying the closed side setting by two is a good guide to the top size of the gradation exiting the machine.

## What is the Difference Between a Jaw Crusher and a Cone Crusher?
The coarse jaw crusher has a large amount of dust emission, while the cone crusher is much better. Compared with the cone crusher, the sealing of the jaw crusher is relatively poor. The cone crusher spreads less dust with a deep crushing cavity. What's more, the materials of jaw crushers are usually larger or sticky, which increases its dust
