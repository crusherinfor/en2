## Cures For Plant Nutrient Deficiencies - Safer® Brand
Cures: Excess calcium, sodium, or nitrogen in your nutrient solution prevents plants from absorbing potassium. Those conditions can be the result of using water that is high in minerals (aka, hard water) or that's been treated with water softeners or synthetic fertilizers. Feed your plants organic nutrients for the right stage of the plants
