## What Is the Reduction Ratio of the Crusher?
Mar 11, 2022Surface reduction ratio: the ratio of the width of the crusher inlet to the width of the outlet. Calculation formula: I=0.85B/S (inlet width/discharge width referred to here) 0.85 is the width coefficient of the crusher to accommodate the material. The value S of the width of the discharge port: the coarse crusher is different from the medium
