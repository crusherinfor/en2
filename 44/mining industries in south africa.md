When mining industries are well managed, countries like Peru, Chile, and Botswana have seen massive economic growth. Mining is crucial for developed nations as well. For example, mining makes up 20% of South Africa's total GDP and employs over 1 million people. People estimate that South Africa sits on over$2.5-trillion in mineral reserves.
