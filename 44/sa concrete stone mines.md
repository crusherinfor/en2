## Limestone Mining - Michigan State University
In construction, crushed stone is used as an aggregate in concrete mixes. The stone binds the mix together when it hardens. Almost 60% of all crushed stone is used as aggregate in highway concrete and asphalt. All crushed stone in Michigan is mined in open quarries. Drilling and blasting are necessary. Crushing is done at the quarry.
