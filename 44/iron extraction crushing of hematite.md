## Extraction of iron from hematite
Lesson Video Extracting Iron Nagwa. Hematite is a naturally occurring form of iron (III) oxide, Fe2O3. And its about 70 percent iron by mass. What this means is that, with perfect extraction, putting one kilogram of ore in, we should get 0.7 kilograms or 700 grams of pure iron out. However, its not quite that simple, so lets look at the details.

The Pilbara region is rich in such hematite ore, known also as "direct shipping ore" (DSO). DSO passes through a simple crushing, screening, and blending process (beneficiation) before it is shipped for steel production. DSOs, when mined, typically have iron (Fe) content of between 56% and 64% Fe.

## How Is Iron Extracted From Its Ore - Realonomics
Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. . The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions. How do you extract ores? There are 3 main methods of extracting metals from their ore.

The iron by its own is usually found in the structure of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite, limonite or siderite. Hematite is also identified as "natural ore". The nomenclature dates back to the early years of drawing out, when certain hematite ores comprised 66% iron and could be fed reliably into iron edifice blast furnaces.

## extraction of iron from hematite
Extraction of Iron from Hematite 1) Concentration Hematite is concentrated by the gravity separation process which is a method based on the difference in specific gravities of the metallic ore and gangue particles The oxide being heavier settles to the bottom while lighter impurities come to the surface and are removed The concentrated ore

## Common Iron Ore Extraction Processes - Mining-pedia
According to the classification of the chemical composition, the iron ore can be divided into magnetite, hematite, limonite and siderite. According to the specific magnetization coefficient, the iron ores can be divided into strong magnetic minerals and weak magnetic minerals, which provides a basis for the process of the extraction of iron ore
