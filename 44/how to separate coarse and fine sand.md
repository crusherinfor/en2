How do you separate grain from husk? Husk is separated from heavier seeds of grain by winnowing. Difference in the size of particles in a mixture is utilised to separate them by the process of sieving and filtration. In a mixture of sand and water, the heavier sand particles settle down at the bottom and the water can be separated by decantation.

## Coarse or fine sand as substrate for natural planted tank?
When using either coarse or fine sand, I use a slightly different method than I use with gravel; as both tend to keep waste and uneaten food on the surface of the substrate, when cleaning, I just sort of whirl the Python end about in order to draw up loose material from the surface, and then just siphon it from there. Seems to work well.

## Surface Area of Soil Separates | Soils - Part 2: Physical  - passel
Sand and silt particles are much larger than clay and are quite inactive chemically because of their mineral composition and limited surface area.  horizon and a silty or sandy subsoil will also have less nutrient-supplying capacity because of the loss of clay — fine, medium, and coarse.
