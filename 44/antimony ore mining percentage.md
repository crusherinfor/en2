Based on a long-term antimony price of $8,500 a ton, the company estimates that the net present value of the project is around $279m. Future outlook. Although mining antimony is cheaper in China because of labour costs and the typically large deposits, the trend in declining production is set to endure.

The antimony ore found in our mine is Stibnite, which is a sulfide bearing ore and is concentrated using a froth flotation process. Typical output is min 20% Sb for roasters, min 25% Sb for blast furnace smelters and min 45% Sb for liquators that melt the antimony sulfide in a reducing atmosphere.

##  Antimony - USGS
The most common antimony ore mineral is stibnite (Sb 2 S 3 ), but more than 100 other minerals also contain antimony. The presence of antimony in surface waters and groundwaters results primarily from rock weathering, soil runoff, and anthropogenic sources. Global emissions of antimony to the atmosphere average 6,100 metric tons per year.

While roughly 100 tons of ore from mining shipped from Sliscovich in 1914 and 1915 contained about 35 percent antimony, the value of the gold and silver in this ore outweighed the critical mineral. "Antimony is often a high-level indicator of deeper gold deposits," said Barker.
