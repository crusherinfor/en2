Coal ash includes a number of by-products produced from burning coal, including: Fly Ash, a very fine, powdery material composed mostly of silica made from the burning of finely ground coal in a boiler. Bottom Ash, a coarse, angular ash particle that is too large to be carried up into the smoke stacks so it forms in the bottom of the coal furnace.

## Coal Washing | Encyclopedia
Coal washing is accomplished by one of two major processes, by density separation or by froth flotation. Both processes depend on the fact that the particles of which a coal sample are made have different densities. When water, for example, is added to the sample, particles sink to various depths depending on their densities.

next objective was to reintroduce the fines to the coal-handling system without creating additional air entrainment of the dust. First attempts involved blending the coal fines with the crushed coal on the conveyors that feed the coal bunkers. This created a dust problem at the bunker as well as problems in blending the coal on the conveyor.

Clean coal is an energy that can generally be used as fuel, the fine coal of bituminous coal is generally used for coking. The main reasons of washing coal are as bellow: 1. Improve coal quality and reduce emissions of coal-fired pollutants. Coal washing can remove 50%-80% of ash and 30%-40% of total sulfur (or 60%~80% of inorganic sulfur) in coal.

What you need is a french drain with coal fill over a sand bed. Nowadays you'll need a membrane under the sand. Just over the sand you place fine coal and gradually build up to about 50mm in the top layer. slurry gets slowed down by the top layer and can percolate down to the membrane which will direct it to your pond.
