Other parameters controlling the milling process are powder to media ratio and solids content of the slurry. As shown in Figure 7, low powder to media ratio and solid content not only reduce milling time but also reduce productivity of the milling process. Therefore, these parameters need to be optimized based on powder characteristics and

Mill scale is iron oxide that forms on a surface during hot rolling of steel.

## Milling Environment - Powder Metallurgy - Beyond Discovery
According to Arias (Ref 9), two classifications of chemical activity exist between metal powders and the milling environment--reactive and nonreactive milling. In reactive milling, metal powders react extensively with the milling fluid during milling. The metal powder is comminuted to a particle size much smaller than the starting powder.
