A test sample of the fine aggregate was weighed as shown in step 1 in test 1. The sieve sizes used for this test were #4, #8, #16, #30, #50, and #100. The sieves were arranged in an ascending order so as to compute the finest modulus. Steps 3 to 8 in test I were followed and the determined values recorded in table 2.

## Sieve analysis
A sieve analysis (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used in civil engineering and chemical engineering to assess the particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a granular material by allowing the material to pass through a series of sieves of progressively smaller mesh size and weighing the amount of material that is stopped by each sieve as a fraction of the whole mass.

## SIEVE ANALYSIS OF FINE AGGREGATES - All About Civil Engineering
The aggregate fraction from 4.75 to 75 micron is referred to as fine aggregates. Fine aggregate is the sand used in mortars, coarse aggregates is the broken stone or gravel, and all in one aggregate is the combination of fine and coarse aggregates. The coarse aggregates unless mixed with fine aggregates do not produce good quality of concrete.
