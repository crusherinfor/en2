## Investigation on grinding impact of fly ash particles and its 
The cement grinding mill circuit loaded approximately 95% through clinker raw materials and rest of the feeding material is performing properties enhancer, . In grinding process, the quality of cement in terms of fineness was measured by using Blaine's surface area and particle size distribution analysis [18] .

## The Raw Materials Of Concrete Hollow Block
The main component of quicklime is CaO, which is generally in the form of a block, pure white, and pale gray or yellowish when it contains impurities. Quicklime absorbs moisture or adds water to become hydrated lime. Its main component is Ca (OH)2. Gypsum. Production of fly ash aerated concrete hollow block, all kinds of gypsum can be used.
