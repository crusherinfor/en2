Pelletizing is a non-pressure agglomeration method, whereby material fines tumble against each other in the presence of a binding agent. The material fines become tacky, stick together, and pick up more fines as they tumble, in a process known as coalescence.

## Sintering vs Melting: What's the Difference?
It's important because sintering can occur at low temperatures in the right conditions. Take, for example, snow. Snow, when compacted into a ball by a child, would be an example of pressure-based sintering. Basically, sintering can be an operation of either pressure or temperature, while melting is primarily an operation of temperature.
