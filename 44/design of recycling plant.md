##  Development and visualisation of a recycling plant - DiVA portal
To visualise the concept CAD was used to model the recycling plant. The plant was animated and set in the right environment to give an as realistic picture as possible. This was done in KeyShot for the interior modelling and in 3ds Max for the exterior modelling.

## The importance of design in lithium ion battery recycling - a critical 
Recycling is always seen as an end-of-pipe process returning as much material as possible into a circular economy. There is a growing school of thought that suggests product design should be an important step in the recycling process. While this review is aimed specifically at one technological product, it c Precious Elements Inorganic chemistry approaches to saving critical elements: Recovery
