## How Do They Separate The Coal From The Other Rock??
Coal miners use two primary methods to remove coal . Surface mining is often used when coal is less than 200 feet underground. In surface mining large machines remove the topsoil and layers of rock known as overburden to expose coal seams. . The miners use large machines to dig out the coal.

Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.
