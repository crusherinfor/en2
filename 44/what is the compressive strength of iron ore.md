## Fairies and ironatris
Fairies were believed to be frightened of iron, so a tongs was sometimes placed over the cradle. The colour red was said to remind them of their fate on Judgment Day, so the colour red was believed to ward them off. Babies could also be sprinkled with holy water or, sometimes, urine, because fairies did not like dirty babies.
