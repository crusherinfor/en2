Since the weight of concrete per cubic foot is 150 lbs, the weight of 3 cubic feet of concrete will be 3×150 = 450 lbs (pounds). That means a concrete of 3 foot width, 3 foot height, and 3 foot length will have a weight of 450 pounds (if it is a solid slab). For a broken concrete, the weight of 3 cubic feet will be 3×75 = 225 pounds.
