A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

The starting point for ball mill media and solids charging generally starts as follows: 50% media charge. Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non-spherical, irregularly shaped and mixed-size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space. Add to this another 10%-15% above the ball charge for total of 23%

In the ball-and-race mill (Fig. 13.3), balls are held between two races, much like a large ball bearing.The top race or grinding ring remains stationary while the bottom race rotates. As the coal is ground between large diameter balls and the ring, the balls are free to rotate on all axes and therefore remain spherical.
