What Mining Process Is Used For Zinc. Zinc mining is the process by which mineral forms of the metal zinc are extracted from the earth through mining. A zinc mine is a mine that produces zinc metal. Some mines produce primarily zinc, but some mines produce zinc as a side-product of some metal that has a higher concentration in the ore.
