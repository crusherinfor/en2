A team of engineers at Drexel University have developed a "green" version of ordinary Portland cement (OPC). By using a form of alkali-activated cement that utilizes slag, limestone, and does not require heating to produce, their cement reduces energy consumption and carbon dioxide production by 97% and decreases material cost by 40%.

Spotted: The current process for creating portland cement—one of the world's most common building materials—consists of heating limestone to high temperatures.Today, limestone for cement production is quarried. As a result, the heating process releases carbon that would otherwise be locked away in the earth into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide.

It is mixed with sand, gravel and water to produce concrete, the most widely used construction material in the world.Over 10bn tonnes of concrete are used each year.. The industry standard is a type called Portland cement.This was invented in the early 1800s and named after a building stone widely used in England
