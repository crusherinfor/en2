## Interest Rate Effect on Aggregate Demand | Investing Post
Identification. Aggregate demand is a macroeconomic term referring to the total goods and services in an economy at a particular price level. Plotting these two on a graph produces what's called an aggregate demand curve, reflecting the fact that prices and demand are subject to change. The AD curve has a downward slope, because as prices

One of several specific aggregate demand determinants assumed constant when the aggregate demand curve is constructed, and that shifts the aggregate demand curve when it changes. An increase in interest rates cause a decrease (leftward shift) of the aggregate curve. A decrease in interest rates an increase (rightward shift) of the aggregate curve.

## Consumer Income, Interest Rates, Aggregate Demand and Supply
Unemployment, expectations, consumer income, and interest rates have an existing effect of the economic factors on aggregate demand and supply. When unemployment rates are high, households have less money to spend. If there is less money in a household, people will need to budget and focus on the necessities.

## interest rate effect on aggregate demand
Answer (1 of 2): Aggregate Demand is affected by the real interest rate. For example, in a recessionary economy, aggregate demand is inadequate relative to aggregate supply and is thereby causing unemployment to rise. Monetary policy is thought to increase aggregate demand through expansionary tools.
