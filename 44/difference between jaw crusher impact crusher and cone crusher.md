## Impact Crusher vs. Jaw crusher, Which One Should I Choose
Jaw crushers are often used in primary crushing applications. Impact crushers are usually used for applications where the stone is softer, has a lower density and less abrasive. The high-speed rotating rotor throws the stone into the impact toggles, and the impact energy generated by the rotor breaks the rock along its natural fracture line.

Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall.
