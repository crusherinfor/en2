## How to Use Diatomaceous Earth: All You Need to Know
Diatomaceous Earth is a great tool to use in your fight against bed bugs. It's an all-natural, non-toxic barrier to bed bugs that can both kill them and prevent them from moving freely throughout your house. While diatomaceous earth does not kill the bugs immediately (it can take 7 to 17 days) it does have long-lasting, effective results.
