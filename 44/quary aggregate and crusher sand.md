## A starter's guide to screens and screen media : Pit & Quarry
The process starts when the rocks that pass through the crusher land on a conveyor belt that takes the material up to what's called a screen tower. The rocks drop onto the screens, and the physical screening begins. The most typical screens used in a quarry are inclined, set at a 20-degree angle.

## What is Aggregate And The Different Types of Aggregates
Natural Aggregate. Using natural rocks (such as limestone, granite, basalt, etc.) mined as raw materials, aggregates made by physical crushing are called natural aggregates, such as sand, crushed stone, gravel, etc. It is an important part of concrete and is widely used in urban road engineering, bridges, buildings and other infrastructure fields.
