## 2020 Crushed Stone Calculator: 3/4 inch rock - HomeAdvisor
Jan 20, 2021As an example, a 10-foot wide, 20-foot long driveway is a 200-square foot area. Then, multiply the area by the depth. For instance, if you are using four inches of crushed stone under a patio area or for a driveway, four inches converted to feet is .33. So, our calculation is .33 x 200 ÷ 27, or 2.46 cubic yards.

## Crushed Gravel, Stone and Rock Sizes - Chart and Grades
Crushed Stone #1: Approx. 2″-4″ Wide. Crushed stone grade no. 1 is the largest size with diameters ranging from around 2 inches to 4 inches. As this grade contains larger pieces, it's not suitable for shoveling and stones will need to be moved individually. Typical uses for gravel #1 include: Filling larger holes.

The angle of internal friction of a crushed stone will be directly influenced by type of rock and grain size. Forty-one (41) seems to me possible, but dangerous.
