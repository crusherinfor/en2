## Crushed gravel size chartte-freres-chaudronnerie.fr
Because gravel comes in a number of different shapes, sizes, and colors, it may be used in landscaping as a decoration or an accent while also providing potential benefits such as drainage.  Crushed stone is a type of medium-sized gravel that is formed by mechanically crushing stone. Most commonly, limestone, dolomite, or granite is crushed.

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
Crushed stone often has an angular and jagged edge that occurs during the crushing process. Gravel, on the other hand, typically has a very smooth texture and surface because of the natural weathering and wear of being exposed to the effects of running water.  Like granite, it can be polished well and is often used for decorative purposes
