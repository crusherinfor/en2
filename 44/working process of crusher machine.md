Working Principle of Jaw Crusher: You might ask that how a jaw type crusher works. Here, I will introduce its working principle: When the rock crushing machine works, motor drives belt and pulley, and the eccentric shaft drives the mobile jaw plate. When the mobile jaw plate rises, the angle between elbow plate and mobile jaw plate becomes larger.
