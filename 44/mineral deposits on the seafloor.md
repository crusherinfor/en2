## The Promise and Perils of Seafloor Mining
The metals lie in what are called seafloor massive sulfide deposits. They form as the result of a series of chemical reactions that start when seawater filters down through permeable ocean crust into rocks heated by magma below. The heat catalyzes reactions that leach metals from the rocks into the fluids.

Volcanic vents are one source of mineral deposits on the seafloor. Explanation: Volcanic vents are openings which are exposed on the earth's surface where volcanic material is discharged or emitted. They originated in the magma chamber which is an underground pool of liquefied rock located underneath the surface of the Earth.

Because the ocean floor covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface, many expect the oceans to contain a proportionate amount of the world's mineral resources, comparing the resource potential of seafloor massive sulfide deposits to that of deposits now mined on land for Cu, Zn, Pb, Ag and Au (Rona 2003; Cathles 2011).

## mineral deposits on the seafloor
The seafloor contains deposits of minerals that we we use in everyday life such as copper, zinc, nickel, gold, silver, and phosphorus These deposits occur as crusts on volcanic and other rocks and as nodules on abyssal plain sediment that are typically about 3 to 10 centimeters 1 to 4 inches in diameter

## Seafloor Massive Sulfides â€” Mineral Resources & Tectonics
Seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits, also known as hydrothermal ore deposits or black smoker vents, form when a magmatic heat source drives the circulation of seawater through the ocean crust, where it leaches metals from the rocks. Metals may also be contributed by magmatic fluids that are degassing from the underlying magma chamber.

These metal-containing deposits are located around mid-ocean ridges where the sea floor is, or was, volcanically active. Mineral-rich superhot water from underlying magma meets cold deep seawater and forms a crust on the seafloor at a depth that is often richer in minerals, particularly copper, than can be found in land deposits.

## On mapping seafloor mineral deposits with central loop transient 
ABSTRACT Electromagnetic methods are commonly employed in exploration for land-based mineral deposits. A suite of airborne, land, and borehole electromagnetic techniques consisting of different coil and dipole configurations have been developed over the last few decades for this purpose. In contrast, although the commercial value of marine mineral deposits has been recognized for decades, the

## Rapid growth of mineral deposits at artificial seafloor hydrothermal 
The high growth rate reaching the 15 m height within 25 months is attributed to the large hydrothermal vent more than 50 cm in diameter created by the borehole, which induced slow mixing with the ambient seawater and enhanced efficiency of sulphide deposition. These observations suggest the possibility of cultivating seafloor sulphide deposits

## Seafloor massive sulfide deposits
the most common minerals in ore-bearing associations of volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits (non-metamorphosed or oxidized) and their modern analogues are pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, covellite, sphalerite, galena, tetrahedrite - tennantite, marcasite, realgar, orpiment, proustite - pyrargyrite, wurtzite, stannite ( sulfides ), mn oxides, .
