## Belts
Belts coated with silicone provide excellent release properties, high-temperature resistance, and good hydrolysis- and chemical resistance. The use of a silicone coating must always respect the mechanical limits of this elastomeric material, which is subject to scratch and wear and can thus lose its properties in rough applications. Open ended and endless coating.

Insert the gauge pin through the fastener loops; break off the bolts, and grind to a finish. Use the gauge pin as a guide to insert the filler tube. Once it's in place, remove the gauge pin. Repeat these steps on the other belt end and join the ends together. Insert the gauge pin through both sets of fastener loops.

First the belt needs to be audited and problem areas identified. Next the conveyor idlers and drum pulleys should be aligned, so that correct loading in the centre of the belt can be achieved. Belt tracking devices should be installed to ensure that the belt remains level and "true" under all operating conditions.

The alternative is to mount the reducer directly to the pulley shaft, and the motor to the reducer, with the fluid coupling inserted at an appropriate location in the system. This latter approach, mounting directly to the pulley shaft, is what's called alignment-free. The point is that no alignment is required because it's provided by the shafts.
